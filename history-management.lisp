; Section:  Proof Trees

; We develop proof trees in this file, rather than in prove.lisp, because
; print-summary calls print-proof-tree.

; A goal tree is a structure of the following form, with the fields indicated
; below.  We put the two non-changing fields at the end; note:

; ACL2 p>:sbt 4

; The Binary Trees with Four Tips
; 2.000  ((2 . 2) 2 . 2)
; 2.250  (1 2 3 . 3)

(defrec goal-tree (children processor cl-id . fanout) nil)

; Cl-id is a clause-id record for the name of the goal.

; Children is a list of goal trees whose final cdr is either nil or a positive
; integer.  In the latter case, this positive integer indicates the remaining
; number of children for which to build goal trees.

; Fanout is the original number of children.

; Processor is one of the processors from *preprocess-clause-ledge* (except for
; settled-down-clause, which has no use here), except that we have two special
; annotations and two "fictitious" processors.

; Instead of push-clause, we use (push-clause cl-id), where cl-id is the
; clause-id of the clause pushed (e.g., the clause-id corresponding to "*1").
; Except: (push-clause cl-id :REVERT) is used when we are reverting to the
; original goal, and in this case, cl-id always corresponds to *1; also,
; (push-clause cl-id :ABORT) is used when the proof is aborted by push-clause.

; Instead of a processor pr, we may have (pr :forced), which indicates that
; this processor forced assumptions (but remember, some of those might get
; proved during the final clean-up phase).  When we enter the next forcing
; round, we will "decorate" the above "processor" by adding a list of new goals
; created by that forcing: (pr :forced clause-id_1 ... clause-id_n).  As we go
; along we may prune away some of those new clause ids.

; Finally, occasionally the top-level node in a goal-tree is "fictitious", such
; as the one for "[1]Goal" if the first forcing round presented more than one
; forced goal, and such as any goal to be proved by induction.  In that case,
; the "processor" is one of the keyword labels :INDUCT or :FORCING-ROUND or a
; list headed by such keywords, e.g. if we want to say what induction scheme is
; being used.

; A proof tree is simply a non-empty list of goal trees.  The "current" goal
; tree is the CAR of the current proof tree; it's the one for the current
; forcing round or proof by induction.

; There is always a current proof tree, (@ proof-tree), except when we are
; inhibiting proof-tree output or are not yet in a proof.  The current goal in
; a proof is always the first one associated with the first subtree of the
; current goal-tree that has a non-nil final CDR, via a left-to-right
; depth-first traversal of that tree.  We keep the proof tree pruned, trimming
; away proved subgoals and their children.

; The proof tree is printed to the screen, enclosed in #\n\<0 ... #\n\>.  We
; start with # because that seems like a rare character, and we want to leave
; emacs as unburdened as possible in its use of string-matching.  And, we put a
; newline in front of \ because in ordinary PRINT-like (as opposed to
; PRINC-like) printing, as done by the prover, \ is always quoted and hence
; would not appear in a sequence such as <newline>\?, where ? is any character
; besides \.  Naturally, this output can be inhibited, simply by putting
; 'proof-tree on the state global variable inhibit-output-lst.  Mike Smith has
; built, and we have modified, a "filter" tool for redirecting such output in a
; nice form to appropriate emacs buffers.  People who do not want to use the
; emacs facility (or some other display utility) should probably inhibit
; proof-tree output using :stop-proof-tree.

  proof tree displays~/

  A view of ACL2 proofs may be obtained by way of ``proof tree displays,''
  which appear in proof output (~pl[proofs-co]) when proof-tree output is
  enabled (see below) When ACL2 starts a proof and proof-tree output is
  enabled, the proof output begins with the following string.
  ~bv[]
  << Starting proof tree logging >>
  ~ev[]
  Then for each goal encountered during the proof, a corresponding proof tree
  display (as described below) is printed into the proof output: first the
  characters in the constant string ~c[*proof-tree-start-delimiter*] are
  printed, then the proof tree display, and finally the characters in the
  constant string ~c[*proof-tree-end-delimiter*].

  External tools may present proof tree displays in a separate window.  In
  particular, a tool distributed with the ACL2 community books customizes the
  emacs environment to provide window-based proof tree displays together with
  commands for traversing the proof transcript; see the discussion of ``ACL2
  proof-tree support'' in file ~c[emacs/emacs-acl2.el] distributed with ACL2.

  The command ~c[:start-proof-tree] enables proof-tree output, while
  ~c[:stop-proof-tree] disables proof-tree output; ~pl[start-proof-tree] and
  ~pl[stop-proof-tree].~/

  Here is an example of a proof tree display, with comments.  Lines marked with
  ``c'' are considered ``checkpoints,'' i.e., goals whose scrutiny may be of
  particular value.

  ~ev[]
  ~l[proof-tree-examples] for many examples that contain proof tree displays.
  But first, we summarize the kinds of lines that may appear in a proof tree
  display.  The simplest form of a proof tree display is a header showing the
  current event, followed by list of lines, each having one of the following
  forms.
  ~bv[]
      n <goal> <process> ...
  ~ev[]
  Says that the indicated goal created ~c[n] subgoals using the indicated
  process.  Here ``...'' refers to possible additional information.
  ~bv[]
  c   n <goal> <process> ...
  ~ev[]
  As above, but calls attention to the fact that this goal is a ``checkpoint''
  in the sense that it may be of particular interest.  Some displays may
  overwrite ``c'' with ``>'' to indicate the current checkpoint being shown in
  the proof transcript.
  ~bv[]
       |  <goal> ...
       |  |  <k subgoals>
  ~ev[]
  Indicates that the goal just above this line, which is pointed to by the
  rightmost vertical bar (``|''), has ~c[k] subgoals, none of which have yet
  been processed.
  ~bv[]
       |  <goal> ...
       |  |  <k more subgoals>
  ~ev[]
  As above, except that some subgoals have already been processed.
  ~bv[]

  ~ev[]
  Separates successive passes through the ``waterfall''.  Thus, this
  ``fencepost'' mark indicates the start of a new proof by induction or of a
  new forcing round.

(deflabel proof-tree-examples

  ":Doc-Section Proof-tree

  proof tree example~/

  ~l[proof-tree] for an introduction to proof trees, and for a list of related
  topics.  Here we present a detailed example followed by a shorter example
  that illustrates proof by induction.~/

  Consider the ~il[guard] proof for the definition of a function
  ~c[cancel_equal_plus]; the body of this definition is of no importance
  here.  The first proof tree display is:
  ~bv[]
  ( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)
    18 Goal preprocess
       |  <18 subgoals>
  ~ev[]
  This is to be read as follows.
  ~bq[]
   At this stage of the proof we have encountered the top-level goal,
   named \"Goal\", which generated 18 subgoals using the
   ``preprocess'' process.  We have not yet begun to work on those
   subgoals.
  ~eq[]
  The corresponding message from the ordinary prover output is:
  ~bq[]
   By case analysis we reduce the conjecture to the following 18
   conjectures.
  ~eq[]
  Note that the field just before the name of the goal (~c[\"Goal\"]), which
  here contains the number 18, indicates the number of cases (children) created
  by the goal using the indicated process.  This number will remain unchanged
  as long as this goal is displayed.

  The next proof tree display is:
  ~bv[]
  ( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)
    18 Goal preprocess
     1 |  Subgoal 18 simp
       |  |  <1 subgoal>
       |  <17 more subgoals>
  ~ev[]
  which indicates that at this point, the prover has used the simplification
  (``simp'') process on Subgoal 18 to create one subgoal (``<1 subgoal>'').
  The vertical bar (``|'') below ``Subgoal 18'', accompanied by the line below
  it, signifies that there are 17 siblings of Subgoal 18 that remain to be
  processed.

  The next proof tree displayed is:
  ~bv[]
  ( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)
    18 Goal preprocess
     1 |  Subgoal 18 simp
  c  2 |  |  Subgoal 18' ELIM
       |  |  |  <2 subgoals>
       |  <17 more subgoals>
  ~ev[]
  Let us focus on the fourth line of this display:
  ~bv[]
  c  2 |  |  Subgoal 18' ELIM
  ~ev[]

  The ``c'' field marks this goal as a ``checkpoint'', i.e., a goal worthy of
  careful scrutiny.  In fact, any goal that creates children by a process other
  than ``preprocess'' or ``simp'' is marked as a checkpoint.  In this case, the
  destructor-elimination (``~il[ELIM]'') process has been used to create
  subgoals of this goal.  The indentation shows that this goal, Subgoal 18', is
  a child of Subgoal 18.  The number ``2'' indicates that 2 subgoals have been
  created (by ~il[ELIM]).  Note that this information is consistent with the
  line just below it, which says ``<2 subgoals>''.

  Finally, the last line of this proof tree display,
  ~bv[]
       |  <17 more subgoals>
  ~ev[]
  is connected by vertical bars (``|'') up to the string ~c[\"Subgoal 18\"],
  which suggests that there are 17 immediate subgoals of Goal remaining to
  process after Subgoal 18.  Note that this line is indented one level from the
  second line, which is the line for the goal named ~c[\"Goal\"].  The display
  is intended to suggest that the subgoals of Goal that remain to be proved
  consist of Subgoal 18 together with 17 more subgoals.

  The next proof tree display differs from the previous one only in that now,
  Subgoal 18' has only one more subgoal to be processed.
  ~bv[]
  ( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)
    18 Goal preprocess
     1 |  Subgoal 18 simp
  c  2 |  |  Subgoal 18' ELIM
       |  |  |  <1 more subgoal>
       |  <17 more subgoals>
  ~ev[]
  Note that the word ``more'' in ``<1 more subgoal>'' tells us that there was
  originally more than one subgoal of Subgoal 18.  In fact that information
  already follows from the line above, which (as previously explained) says
  that Subgoal 18' originally created 2 subgoals.

  The next proof tree display occurs when the prover completes the proof of
  that ``1 more subgoal'' referred to above.
  ~bv[]
  ( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)
    18 Goal preprocess
       |  <17 more subgoals>
  ~ev[]
  Then, Subgoal 17 is processed and creates one subgoal, by simplification:
  ~bv[]
  ( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)
    18 Goal preprocess
     1 |  Subgoal 17 simp
       |  |  <1 subgoal>
       |  <16 more subgoals>
  ~ev[]
  ... and so on.

  Later in the proof one might find the following successive proof tree
  displays.
  ~bv[]
  ( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)
    18 Goal preprocess
       |  <9 more subgoals>

  ( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)

    18 Goal preprocess
     0 |  Subgoal 9 simp (FORCED)
       |  <8 more subgoals>
  ~ev[]
  These displays tell us that Subgoal 9 simplified to ~c[t] (note that the
  ``0'' shows clearly that no subgoals were created), but that some rule's
  hypotheses were ~il[force]d.  Although this goal is not checkpointed (i.e.,
  no ``c'' appears on the left margin), one can cause such goals to be
  checkpointed; ~pl[checkpoint-forced-goals].

  In fact, the proof tree displayed at the end of the ``main proof''(the 0-th
  forcing round) is as follows.
  ~bv[]
  ( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)
    18 Goal preprocess
     0 |  Subgoal 9 simp (FORCED)
     0 |  Subgoal 8 simp (FORCED)
     0 |  Subgoal 7 simp (FORCED)
     0 |  Subgoal 6 simp (FORCED)
     0 |  Subgoal 4 simp (FORCED)
     0 |  Subgoal 3 simp (FORCED)
  ~ev[]
  This is followed by the following proof tree display at the start
  of the forcing round.
  ~bv[]
    18 Goal preprocess
     0 |  Subgoal 9 simp (FORCED [1]Subgoal 4)
     0 |  Subgoal 8 simp (FORCED [1]Subgoal 6)
     0 |  Subgoal 7 simp (FORCED [1]Subgoal 1)
     0 |  Subgoal 6 simp (FORCED [1]Subgoal 3)
     0 |  Subgoal 4 simp (FORCED [1]Subgoal 5)
     0 |  Subgoal 3 simp (FORCED [1]Subgoal 2)
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
     6 [1]Goal FORCING-ROUND
     2 |  [1]Subgoal 6 preprocess
       |  |  <2 subgoals>
       |  <5 more subgoals>
  ~ev[]
  This display shows which goals to ``blame'' for the existence of each goal in
  the forcing round.  For example, Subgoal 9 is to blame for the creation of
  [1]Subgoal 4.

  Actually, there is no real goal named ~c[\"[1~]Goal\"].  However, the line
  ~bv[]
     6 [1]Goal FORCING-ROUND
  ~ev[]
  appears in the proof tree display to suggest a ``parent'' of the six
  top-level goals in that forcing round.  As usual, the numeric field before
  the goal name contains the original number of children of that (virtual, in
  this case) goal ~-[] in this case, 6.

  In our example proof, Subgoal 6 eventually gets proved, without doing any
  further forcing.  At that point, the proof tree display looks as follows.
  ~bv[]
  ( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)
    18 Goal preprocess
     0 |  Subgoal 9 simp (FORCED [1]Subgoal 4)
     0 |  Subgoal 7 simp (FORCED [1]Subgoal 1)
     0 |  Subgoal 6 simp (FORCED [1]Subgoal 3)
     0 |  Subgoal 4 simp (FORCED [1]Subgoal 5)
     0 |  Subgoal 3 simp (FORCED [1]Subgoal 2)
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
     6 [1]Goal FORCING-ROUND
       |  <5 more subgoals>
  ~ev[]
  Notice that the line for Subgoal 8,
  ~bv[]
     0 |  Subgoal 8 simp (FORCED [1]Subgoal 6)
  ~ev[]
  no longer appears.  That is because the goal [1]Subgoal 6 has been proved,
  along with all its children; and hence, the proof of Subgoal 8 no longer
  depends on any further reasoning.

  The final two proof tree displays in our example are as follows.
  ~bv[]
  ( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)
    18 Goal preprocess
     0 |  Subgoal 7 simp (FORCED [1]Subgoal 1)
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
     6 [1]Goal FORCING-ROUND
     2 |  [1]Subgoal 1 preprocess
     1 |  |  [1]Subgoal 1.1 preprocess
     1 |  |  |  [1]Subgoal 1.1' simp
  c  3 |  |  |  |  [1]Subgoal 1.1'' ELIM
       |  |  |  |  |  <1 more subgoal>

  ( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)
  <<PROOF TREE IS EMPTY>>
  ~ev[]
  The explanation for the empty proof tree is simple: once [1]Subgoal 1.1.1 was
  proved, nothing further remained to be proved.  In fact, the much
  sought-after ``Q.E.D.'' appeared shortly after the final proof tree was
  displayed.

  Let us conclude with a final, brief example that illustrates proof by
  induction.  Partway through the proof one might come across the following
  proof tree display.
  ~bv[]
  ( DEFTHM PLUS-TREE-DEL ...)
     1 Goal preprocess
     2 |  Goal' simp
  c  0 |  |  Subgoal 2 PUSH *1
       |  |  <1 more subgoal>
  ~ev[]
  This display says that in the attempt to prove a theorem called
  ~c[plus-tree-del], preprocessing created the only child Goal' from Goal, and
  Goal' simplified to two subgoals.  Subgoal 2 is immediately pushed for proof
  by induction, under the name ``*1''.  In fact if Subgoal 1 simplifies to
  ~c[t], then we see the following successive proof tree displays after the one
  shown above.
  ~bv[]
  ( DEFTHM PLUS-TREE-DEL ...)
     1 Goal preprocess
     2 |  Goal' simp
  c  0 |  |  Subgoal 2 PUSH *1

  ( DEFTHM PLUS-TREE-DEL ...)
     1 Goal preprocess
     2 |  Goal' simp
  c  0 |  |  Subgoal 2 PUSH *1
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  c  6 *1 INDUCT
       |  <5 more subgoals>
  ~ev[]
  The separator ``+++++...'' says that we are beginning another trip through
  the waterfall.  In fact this trip is for a proof by induction (as opposed to
  a forcing round), as indicated by the word ``INDUCT''.  Apparently *1.6 was
  proved immediately, because it was not even displayed; a goal is only
  displayed when there is some work left to do either on it or on some goal
  that it brought (perhaps indirectly) into existence.

  Once a proof by induction is completed, the ``PUSH'' line that refers to that
  proof is eliminated (``pruned'').  So for example, when the present proof by
  induction is completed, the line
  ~bv[]
  c  0 |  |  Subgoal 2 PUSH *1
  ~ev[]
  is eliminated, which in fact causes the lines above it to be eliminated
  (since they no longer refer to unproved children).  Hence, at that point one
  might expect to see:
  ~bv[]
  ( DEFTHM PLUS-TREE-DEL ...)
  <<PROOF TREE IS EMPTY>>
  ~ev[]
  However, if the proof by induction of *1 necessitates further proofs by
  induction or a forcing round, then this ``pruning'' will not yet be done.")

  1.  When proof tree display is enabled (because the command
  ~c[:]~ilc[stop-proof-tree] has not been executed, or has been superseded by a
  later ~c[:]~ilc[start-proof-tree] command), then time summaries will include
  the time for proof tree display.  This time includes the time spent computing
  with proof trees, such as the pruning process described briefly above.  Even
  when proof trees are not displayed, such as when their display is turned off
  in the middle of a proof, this time will be printed if it is not 0.

  2.  When a goal is given a ~c[:bye] in a proof (~pl[hints]), it is treated
  for the purpose of proof tree display just as though it had been proved.

  3.  Several ~il[state] global variables affect proof tree display.
  ~c[(@ proof-tree-indent)] is initially the string ~c[\"| \"]:  it is
  the string that is laid down the appropriate number of times to effect
  indentation.  ~c[(@ proof-tree-buffer-width)] is initially the value of
  ~c[(fmt-soft-right-margin state)], and is used to prevent printing of the
  annotation ``(~il[force]d ...)'' in any greater column than this value.
  However, ~c[(assign proof-tree-buffer-width nil)] to avoid any such
  suppression.  Finally, ~c[(@ checkpoint-processors)] is a list of processors
  from the constant list ~c[*preprocess-clause-ledge*], together with
  ~c[:induct].  You may remove elements of ~c[(@ checkpoint-processors)] to
  limit which processes are considered checkpoints, but note that this can
  affect what is printed by gag-mode (~pl[set-gag-mode]).

  4.  When ~c[:]~ilc[otf-flg] is not set to ~c[t] in a proof, and the prover
  then decides to revert to the original goal and prove it by induction, the
  proof tree display will reflect this fact as shown here:
  ~bv[]
  c  0 |  |  Subgoal 2 PUSH (reverting)
  ~ev[]

  5. The usual ~il[failure] message is printed as part of the prooftree display
  when a proof has failed.")

; Logical Names

; Logical names are names introduced by the event macros listed in
; primitive-event-macros, e.g., they are the names of functions,
; macros, theorems, packages, etc.  Logical names have two main uses
; in this system.  The first is in theory expressions, where logical
; names are used to denote times in the past, i.e., "Give me the list
; of all rules enabled when nm was introduced."  The second is in the
; various keyword commands available to the user to enquire about his
; current state, i.e., "Show me the history around the time nmwas
; introduced."

; The latter use involves the much more sophisticated notion of
; commands as well as that of events.  We will deal with it later.

; We make special provisions to support the mapping from a logical
; name to the world at the time that name was introduced.  At the
; conclusion of the processing of an event, we set the 'global-value
; of 'event-landmark to an "event tuple."  This happens in stop-event.
; Among other things, an event tuple lists the names introduced by the
; event.  The successive settings of 'event-landmark are all visible
; on the world and thus effectively divide the world up into "event
; blocks."  Because the setting of 'event-landmark is the last thing
; we do for an event, the world at the termination of a given event is
; the world whose car is the appropriate event tuple.  So one way to
; find the world is scan down the current world, looking for the
; appropriate event landmark.

; This however is slow, because often the world is not in physical
; memory and must be paged in.  We therefore have worked out a scheme
; to support the faster lookup of names.  We could have stored the
; appropriate world on the property list of each symbolic name.  We
; did not want to do this because it might cause consternation when a
; user looked at the properties.  So we instead associate a unique
; nonnegative integer with each event and provide a mapping from those
; "absolute event numbers" to worlds.  We store the absolute event
; number of each symbolic name on the property list of the name (in
; stop-event).  The only other logical names are the strings that name
; packages.  We find them by searching through the world.

; Event Tuples

; Every time an event occurs we store a new 'global-value for the
; variable 'event-landmark in stop-event.  The value of
; 'event-landmark is an "event tuple."  Abstractly, an event tuple
; contains the following fields:

; n:     the absolute event number
; d:     the embedded event depth (the number of events containing the event)
; form:  the form evaluated that created the event.  (This is often a form
;        typed by the user but might have been a form generated by a macro.
;        The form may be a call of a primitive event macro, e.g., defthm,
;        or may be itself a macro call, e.g., prove-lemma.)
; type:  the name of the primitive event macro we normally use, e.g.,
;        defthm, defuns, etc.
; namex: the name or names of the functions, rules, etc., introduced by
;        the event.  This may be a single object, e.g., 'APP, or "MY-PKG",
;        or may be a true list of objects, e.g., '(F1 F2 F3) as in the case
;        of a mutually recursive clique.  0 (zero) denotes the empty list of
;        names.  The unusual event enter-boot-strap-mode has a namex containing
;        both symbols and strings.
; symbol-class:
;        One of nil, :program, :ideal, or :compliant-common-lisp, indicating
;        the symbol-class of the namex.  (All names in the namex have the same
;        symbol-class.)

; All event tuples are constructed by make-event-tuple, below.  By searching
; for all calls of that function you will ascertain all possible event types
; and namex combinations.  You will find the main call in add-event-landmark,
; which is used to store an event landmark in the world.  There is another call
; in primordial-world-globals, where the bogus initial value of the
; 'event-landmark 'global-value is created with namex 0 and event type nil.
; Add-event-landmark is called in install-event, which is the standard (only)
; way to finish off an ACL2 event.  If you search for calls of install-event
; you will find the normal combinations of event types and namex.  There are
; two other calls of add-event-landmark.  One, in in primordial-world where it
; is called to create the enter-boot-strap-mode event type landmark with namex
; consisting of the primitive functions and known packages.  The other, in
; end-prehistoric-world, creates the exit-boot-strap-mode event type landmark
; with namex 0.

; As of this writing the complete list of type and namex pairs
; is shown below, but the algorithm described above will generate
; it for you if you wish to verify this.

; *Enter-boot-strap-mode introduces the names in *primitive-formals-
; and-guards* and *initial-known-package-alist*.  So its namex is a
; proper list containing both symbols and strings.

; To save space we do not actually represent each event tuple as a 6-tuple but
; have several different forms.  The design of our forms makes the following
; assumptions, aimed at minimizing the number of conses in average usage.  (1)
; Most events are not inside other events, i.e., d is often 0.  (2) Most events
; use the standard ACL2 event macros, e.g., defun and defthm rather than user
; macros, e.g., DEFN and PROVE-LEMMA.  (3) Most events are introduced with the
; :program symbol-class.  This last assumption is just the simple observation
; that until ACL2 is reclassified from :program to :logic, the ACL2
; system code will outweigh any application.

; symbol-class is :program and that the namex can be recovered from the form,
; or else the cadr is the pair (ev-type namex . symbol-class) signalling that

;  ev-type - name of the primitive event macro we use, e.g., defun, defthm, defuns
;  namex - name or names introduced (0 is none)

; Command Tuples

; When LD has executed a world-changing form, it stores a "command tuple" as
; the new 'global-value of 'command-landmark.  These landmarks divide the world
; up into "command blocks" and each command block contains one or or event
; blocks.  Command blocks are important when the user queries the system about
; his current state, wishes to undo, etc.  Commands are enumerated sequentially
; from 0 with "absolute command numbers."

; We define command tuples in a way analogous to event tuples, although
; commands are perhaps simpler because most of their characteristics are
; inherited from the event tuples in the block.  We must store the current
; default-defun-mode so that we can offer to redo :program functions after ubt.
; (A function is offered for redoing if its defun-mode is :program.  But the
; function is redone by executing the command that created it.  The command may
; recreate many functions and specify a :mode for each.  We must re-execute the
; command with the same default-defun-mode we did last to be sure that the
; functions it creates have the same defun-mode as last time.)

; The Event and Command Indices

; How do we convert an absolute event number into the world created by
; that event?  The direct way to do this is to search the world for
; the appropriate binding of 'event-landmark.  To avoid much of this
; search, we keep a map from some absolute event numbers to the
; corresponding tails of world.

; Rather than store an entry for each event number we will store one
; for every 10th.  Actually, *event-index-interval* determines the
; frequency.  This is a completely arbitrary decision.  A typical :ppe
; or :ubt will request a tail within 5 event of a saved one, on the
; average.  At 8 properties per event (the bootstrap right now is
; running 7.4 properties per event), that's about 40 tuples, each of
; the form (name prop . val).  We will always look at name and
; sometimes (1/8 of the time) look at prop and the car of val, which
; says we'll need to swap in about 40+40+1/8(40 + 40) = 90 conses.  We
; have no idea how much this costs (and without arguments about
; locality, it might be as bad as 90 pages!), but it seems little
; enough.  In any case, this analysis suggests that the decision to
; save every nth world will lead to swapping in only 9n conses.

; Assuming that a big proof development costs 3000 events (that's
; about the size of the Piton proof) and that the initial bootstrap is
; about 2000 (right now it is around 1700), we imagine that we will be
; dealing with 5000 events.  So our map from event numbers to
; tails of world will contain about 500 entries.  Of interest here is
; the choice of representation for that map.

; The requirement is that it be a map from the consecutive positive
; integers to tails of world (or nil for integers not yet claimed).
; It should operate comfortably with 500 entries.  It will be the
; value of the world global, 'event-index, and every time we add a
; new entry (i.e., every 10 events), we will rebind that global.
; Thus, by the time the table has 500 entries we will also be holding
; onto the 499 old versions of the table as well.

; Three representations came immediately to mind: a linear array, an
; association list, and a balanced binary tree.  A fourth was invented
; to solve the problem.  We discuss all four here.

; Linear Array.  If the event-index is an array then it will be
; extremely efficient to "search".  We will have to grow the array as
; we go, as we do in load-theory-into-enabled-structure.  So by the
; time the array has 500 entries the underlying Common Lisp array will
; probably contain around 750 words.  The alist version of the array
; will be of length 500 (ignoring the :HEADER) and consume 1000
; conses.  So in all we'll have about 1750 words tied up in this
; structure.  Old versions of the table will share the alist
; representation and cost little.  However, we imagine keeping only
; one Common Lisp array object and it will always hold the compressed
; version of the latest index.  So old versions of the index will be
; "out of date" and will have to be recompressed upon recovery from a
; :ubt, as done by recompress-global-enabled-structure.  This
; complicates the array representation and we have decided to dismiss
; it.

; Alist.  If the event-index is an alist it will typically be 500
; long and contain 1000 conses which are all perfectly shared with old
; copies.  Adding new entries is very fast, i.e., 2 conses.  Lookup is
; relatively slow: .004 seconds, average with an alist of size 500.
; For comparison purposes, we imagine the following scenario: The user
; starts with a world containing 2000 bootstrap events.  He adds
; another 3000 events of his own.  Every event, however, provokes
; him to do 10 :ppes to look at old definitions.  (We are purposefully
; biasing the scenario toward fast lookup times.)  Given the
; convention of saving every 10th tail of world in the index, the
; scenario becomes: The user starts with a index containing 200
; entries.  He grows it to 500 entries.  However, between each growth
; step he inspects 100 entries spread more or less evenly throughout
; the interval.  If the index is represented by an alist, how long
; does this scenario take?  Answer: 77 seconds (running AKCL on a Sun
; 360 with 20Mb).

; Balanced Binary Tree.  We have done an extensive study of the use of
; balanced binary trees (bbts) for this application.  Using bbts, the
; scenario above requires only 13 seconds.  However, bbts use a lot
; more space.  In particular, the bbt for 500 entries consumes 2000
; conses (compared to the alist's 1000 conses).  Worse, the bbt for
; 500 shares little of the structure for 499, while the alist shares
; it all.  (We did our best with structure sharing between successive
; bbts, it's just that rebalancing the tree after an addition
; frequently destroys the possibility for sharing.  Of the 2000 conses
; in the 500 entry bbt, 1028 are new and the rest are shared with the
; 499 bbt.)  In particular, to keep all 500 of the bbts will cost us
; 156,000 conses.  By contrast, the entire world after a bootstrap
; currently costs about 418,000 conses.

; So we need a representation that shares structure and yet is
; efficiently accessed.  Why are alists so slow?  Because we have to
; stop at every entry and ask "is this the one?"  But that is silly
; because we know that if we're looking for 2453 and we see 3000 then
; we have to skip down 547.  That is, our values are all associated
; with consecutive integer indices and the alist is ordered.  But we
; could just use a positional indexing scheme.

; Zap Table.  A zap table is a linear list of values indexed by
; 0-based positions STARTING FROM THE RIGHT.  To enable us to count
; from the right we include, as the first element in the list, the
; maximum index.  For example, the zap table that maps each of the
; integers from 0 to 9 to itself is: (9 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0).  To add
; a new (10th) value to the table, we increment the car by 1 and cons
; the new value to the cdr.  Thus, we spend two conses per entry and
; share all other structure.  To fetch the ith entry we compute how
; far down the list it is with arithmetic and then retrieve it with
; nth.  To our great delight this scheme carries out our scenario in
; 13 seconds, as fast as balanced binary trees, but shares as much
; structure as alists.  This is the method we use.

(defun add-to-zap-table (val zt)

; Given a zap table, zt, that associates values to the indices
; 0 to n, we extend the table to associate val to n+1.

  (cond ((null zt) (list 0 val))
        (t (cons (1+ (car zt)) (cons val (cdr zt))))))

(defun fetch-from-zap-table (n zt)

; Retrieve the value associated with n in the zap table zt, or
; nil if there is no such association.

  (cond ((null zt) nil)
        ((> n (car zt)) nil)
        (t (nth (- (car zt) n) (cdr zt)))))

; These 7 lines of code took 3 days to write -- because we first
; implemented balanced binary trees and did the experiments described
; above.

; Using zap tables we'll keep an index mapping absolute event numbers
; to tails of world.  We'll also keep such an index for commands typed
; by the user at the top-level of the ld loop.  The following two
; constants determine how often we save events and commands in their
; respective indices.

; name, i.e., an alist dotting properties to values.  We map over that list and
; "unbind" those properties of name in wrld that were stored by the event
; introducing name.

; Note: Even when the ld-redefinition-action specifies :overwrite we sometimes
; change it to :erase (see maybe-coerce-overwrite-to-erase).  Thus, this
; function is actually only called on function symbols, not constants or stobjs
; or stobj-live-vars.  The erase version, above, is called on those redefinable
; non-functions.

; Finally, we back up our claim that name must be a function symbol.  The
; reason is that renew-name is the only place that calls renew-name/overwrite
; and it only does that when the renewal-mode is :overwrite or
; :reclassifying-overwrite.  Now renew-name is only called by
; chk-redefineable-namep which sets the renewal-mode using
; redefinition-renewal-mode.

; Finally, if you inspect redefinition-renewal-mode you can see that it only
; returns :overwrite or :reclassifying-overwrite on functions.  The proof of
; this for the :overwrite cases is tedious but pretty straightforward.  Most
; branches through redefinition-renewal-mode signal an error prohibiting the
; redefinition attempt, a few explicitly return :erase, and the normal cases in
; which :overwrite could be returned are all coming out of calls to
; maybe-coerce-overwrite-to-erase, which returns :erase unless the old and new
; type of the event is FUNCTION.

; The harder part of the proof (that only functions get renewal-mode :overwrite
; or :reclassifying-overwrite) is when we return :reclassifying-overwrite.
; Whether redefinition-renewal-mode does that depends on the argument
; reclassifyingp supplied by chk-redefineable-namep, which in turn depends on
; what value of reclassifyingp is supplied to chk-redefineable-namep by its
; only caller, chk-just-new-name, which in turn just passes in the value it is
; supplied by its callers, of which there are many.  However, all but
; chk-acceptable-defuns1 supply reclassifyingp of nil.

; So we know that we reclassify only function symbols and we know that only
; function symbols get :overwrite or :reclassifying-overwrite for their
; renewal-modes.

; renewal-mode, which must be :erase, :overwrite or :reclassifying-overwrite),
; and we put a 'redefined property on name.  Note that we always put the
; 'redefined property, even if name already has that property with that value,
; because one of our interests in this property is in stop-event, which uses it
; to identify which names have been redefined in this event.

; The value of the 'redefined property is (renewal-mode . old-sig),
; where old-sig is either the internal form signature of name if name
; is function and is otherwise nil.

; By storing the renewal-mode we make it possible to recover exactly how the
; final world was obtained from the initial one.  For purposes of renewal, we
; treat renewal-mode :reclassifying-overwrite as :overwrite; the only
; difference is that we store the :reclassifying-overwrite in the 'redefined

  (set-checkpoint-summary-limit n)
  (set-checkpoint-summary-limit t)
  ~ev[]
  where each of ~c[n1] and ~c[n2] is a natural number or ~c[nil].  For the
  second form, ~c[n] can be a natural number or ~c[nil] and is treated as
  ~c[(n . n)].  The value ~c[t] inhibits all printing of checkpoint summary
  information.  The values ~c[n1] and ~c[n2] determine printing of key
  checkpoints generated before the first induction and generated after the
  first induction, respectively, where at most ~c[n1] or ~c[n2] (respectively)
  such key checkpoints are printed unless the value is ~c[nil], in which case
  there is no limitation.

  The argument ~c[x] for ~c[set-checkpoint-summary-limit], as described above,
  may be quoted, i.e. supplied as ~c['x] or ~c[(quote x)].  Thus, you may use
  the keyword form (~pl[keyword-commands]) if you prefer, for example:
  ~bv[]
  :set-checkpoint-summary-limit (nil . 3)
  ~ev[]"

  user-supplied code to initiate ~il[events]~/

  This utility is intended for system hackers, not standard ACL2 users.

  ~l[finalize-event-user] to see how to supply code to be run at the end of
  ~il[events].  We assume familiarity with ~c[finalize-event-user]; here we
  focus on how to supply code for the beginning as well as the end of events.

  As with ~il[finalize-event-user], you attach your own function of argument
  list ~c[(ctx qbody state)] to ~c[initialize-event-user].
  (~l[finalize-event-user] for discussion of ~c[ctx] and ~c[body].)  The
  attachment should return ~c[state] and have a trivial guard,
  requiring (implicitly) only that ~c[state] satisfies ~c[state-p] unless you
  use trust tags to avoid that requirement.  For example:
  ~bv[]
  (defattach initialize-event-user initialize-event-user-test)
  ~ev[]

  Why would you want to do this?  Presumably you are building a system on top
  of ACL2 and you want to track your own data.  For example, suppose you want
  to save the time in some ~il[state] global variable, ~c[my-time].  You could
  do the following.

  ~bv[]

  user-supplied code to complete ~il[events], e.g., with extra summary output~/

  This utility is intended for system hackers, not standard ACL2 users.

  ACL2 prints summaries at the conclusions of processing ~il[events] (unless
  summaries are inhibited; ~pl[set-inhibit-output-lst] and also
  ~pl[set-inhibited-summary-types]).  You may arrange for processing to take
  place just after the summary, by defining a function with argument list
  ~c[(ctx body state)] that returns one value, namely ~c[state].  We describe
  ~c[ctx] and ~c[body] at the end below, but you may simply prefer to ignore
  these arguments.)  Your function should normally be a ~il[guard]-verified
  ~c[:]~ilc[logic] mode function with no guard other than that provided by the
  input requirement on ~ilc[state], that is, ~c[(state-p state)]; but later
  below we discuss how to avoid this requirement.  You then
  attach (~pl[defattach]) your function to the function
  ~c[finalize-event-user].  The following example illustrates how this all
  works.

  with extra printout, for example:

  ~bv[]
  Note: Abbrev-evisc-tuple has its default value.
  ~ev[]

  If the attachment function (above, ~c[finalize-event-user-test]) does not
  meet all the requirements stated above, then you can use the ~c[:skip-checks]
  argument of ~ilc[defattach] to get around the requirement, as illustrated by
  the following example.

  ~bv[]
  (defun finalize-event-user-test2 (state)
    (declare (xargs :stobjs state
                    :mode :program)
             (ignore ctx body))
    (observation
     'my-test
     \"~~|Value of term-evisc-tuple: ~~x0~~|\"
     (f-get-global 'term-evisc-tuple state)))

  (defttag t) ; needed for :skip-checks t

  (defattach (finalize-event-user finalize-event-user-test2)
             :skip-checks t)
  ~ev[]
  So for example:
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>(set-term-evisc-tuple (evisc-tuple 2 7 nil nil) state)
   (:TERM)
  ACL2 !>(defconst *foo6* '(a b c))

  Summary
  Form:  ( DEFCONST *FOO6* ...)
  Rules: NIL
  Time:  0.00 seconds (prove: 0.00, print: 0.00, other: 0.00)

  ACL2 Observation in MY-TEST:
  Value of term-evisc-tuple: (NIL 2 7 NIL)
   *FOO6*
  ACL2 !>
  ~ev[]

  Note that (as of this writing) the macro ~ilc[observation] expands to a call
  of a ~c[:]~ilc[program]-mode function.  Thus, the trick shown above involving
  ~c[:skip-checks] allows the use of ~c[:program]-mode functions; for example,
  you can print with ~ilc[fmt].

  See community book ~c[books/misc/defattach-bang.lisp] for a variant of
  ~ilc[defattach] that uses ~ilc[ec-call] to avoid issues of ~il[guard]
  verification.

  Also ~pl[initialize-event-user], which discusses the handling of ~il[state]
  globals by that utility as well as by ~c[finalize-event-user].~/

  Finally, as promised above, we briefly describe the arguments ~c[ctx] and
  ~c[body].  These are the arguments passed to the call of macro
  ~c[with-ctx-summarized] under which ~c[finalize-event-user] (or
  ~c[initialize-event-user]) was called.  Thus, they are unevaluated
  expressions.  For example, system function ~c[defthm-fn1] has a body of the
  following form.
  ~bv[]
  (with-ctx-summarized
   (if (output-in-infixp state) event-form (cons 'defthm name))
   (let ((wrld (w state))
         (ens (ens state))
         .....
  ~ev[]
  Thus, when ~c[initialize-event-user] and ~c[finalize-event-user] are called
  on behalf of ~ilc[defthm], ~c[ctx] is the s-expression
  ~bv[]
  (if (output-in-infixp state) event-form (cons 'defthm name))
  ~ev[]
  while ~c[body] is the following s-expression (with most code elided).
  ~bv[]
   (let ((wrld (w state))
         (ens (ens state))
         .....
  ~ev[]

  You might find it helpful to use ~ilc[trace$] to get a sense of ~c[ctx] and
  ~c[body], for example, ~c[(trace$ finalize-event-user)].~/")

  limit the number of steps for proofs~/

  Logically, ~c[(with-prover-step-limit expr form)] is equivalent to ~c[form],
  except that if the number of ``prover steps'' executed during evaluation of
  ~c[form] exceeds a bound specified by the value of ~c[expr], then that proof
  will abort.  ~l[set-prover-step-limit] for a related utility that sets the
  limit on prover steps globally instead of setting it for just one form, and
  for a discussion of the notion of ``prover steps'', which could change in
  future ACL2 releases.  For a related utility based on time instead of prover
  steps, ~pl[with-prover-time-limit].

  The arguments of ~c[(with-prover-step-limit expr form)] are evaluated.
  However, the (optional) argument ~c[flg] is not evaluated in
  ~c[(with-prover-step-limit expr flg form)].

  Depending on the machine you are using, you may have less than a half-hour of
  time before the number of prover steps exceeds the maximum limit on prover
  steps that may be imposed, which is one less than the value of
  ~c[*default-step-limit*].  But there is no limit unless you explicitly call
  ~c[with-prover-step-limit] or ~ilc[set-prover-step-limit].

  For examples of how step-limits work besides those presented below, see the
  community book ~c[books/misc/misc2/step-limits.lisp].

  Note that ~c[with-prover-step-limit] may not be called inside definitions,
  and that it is simply the identity macro in raw Lisp.  However,
  ~c[with-prover-step-limit!] may be called in place of
  ~c[with-prover-step-limit], with the effect described here even in raw Lisp.

  Examples:

  ; Limit (mini-proveall) to 100,000 prover steps (which happens to suffice)
  (with-prover-step-limit 100000 (mini-proveall))

  ; Same as above for the inner call of with-prover-step-limit; so the
  ; mini-proveall call completes, but then we get an error because the second
  ; argument of the outer with-prover-step-limit call took more than 200
  ; steps.
  (with-prover-step-limit
   200
   (with-prover-step-limit 100000 (mini-proveall)))

  ; Same as preceding form just above, except that this time there is no error,
  ; because the inner call of with-prover-step-limit has an extra argument
  ; of t inserted into the second argument position, which specifies that this
  ; entire inner call is treated as though it uses no prover steps.
  (with-prover-step-limit
   200
   (with-prover-step-limit 100000 t (mini-proveall)))

  ; The inner call limits (mini-proveall) to 200 prover steps, which fails
  ; almost immediately.
  (with-prover-step-limit 100000 (with-prover-step-limit 200 (mini-proveall)))

  ; Do not limit the number of prover steps, regardless of such a limit imposed
  ; globally or by the surrounding context.
  (with-prover-step-limit nil (mini-proveall))

  ; Same as just above (indeed, nil above is converted to
  ; *default-step-limit*):
  (with-prover-step-limit *default-step-limit* (mini-proveall))

  ; Advanced example: Limit the indicated theorem to 100 steps, and when the
  ; proof does not complete, then put down a label instead.

  General Forms:
  (with-prover-step-limit expr form)
  (with-prover-step-limit expr flg form)
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[form] is an arbitrary form to evaluate, and ~c[expr] evaluates to
  one of the following: ~c[nil]; a natural number not exceeding the value of
  ~c[*default-step-limit*]; or the special value, ~c[:START].  The optional
  extra argument in the second position, ~c[flg], must be Boolean if supplied.

  If the value of ~c[expr] is a natural number less than the value of
  ~c[*default-step-limit*], then that value is the maximum number of prover
  steps permitted during evaluation of ~c[form] before an error occurs.  If
  however the value of ~c[expr] is ~c[nil] or is the value of
  ~c[*default-step-limit*], then no limit is placed on the number of prover
  steps during processing of ~c[form].  Otherwise, the value of ~c[expr] should
  be the keyword ~c[:START], which is intended for use by the ACL2
  implementation and may have semantics that change with new ACL2 versions.

  Finally we describe the optional extra Boolean argument, ~c[flg].  If ~c[flg]
  is ~c[nil] or omitted, then a running count of prover steps is maintained
  after ~c[form] is evaluated; otherwise, that count is not affected by
  evaluation of ~c[form].  To see how this works when ~c[flg] is nil or
  omitted, consider an event of shape ~c[(progn form1 form2)], where we are
  tracking prover steps (say, because of a superior call of
  ~c[with-prover-step-limit]).  If ~c[n] is the number of prover steps
  available when the ~ilc[progn] form is entered, and if ~c[s] prover steps are
  executed while evaluating ~c[form1], then ~c[n-s] steps are available for
  evaluation of ~c[form2] provided ~c[s] does not exceed ~c[n]; otherwise, an
  error occurs.  In particular, this is the case if ~c[form1] is an event
  ~c[(with-prover-step-limit k form1')].  However, if ~c[form1] is an event
  ~c[(with-prover-step-limit k t form1')], then because of the extra argument
  of ~c[t], no steps are ``charged'' to ~c[form]; that is, all ~c[n] steps,
  rather than ~c[n-s] steps, are available for evaluation of ~c[form2].~/"

; Essay on the proved-functional-instances-alist

; The world global 'proved-functional-instances-alist caches information about
; theorems proved on behalf of functional instantiation, in order to avoid the
; cost of re-proving such theorems.  In this Essay we track the flow of
; information to and from that world global.

; The above world global is a list of the following records.

(defrec proved-functional-instances-alist-entry

; Constraint-event-name is the name of an event such that the functional
; instance of that event's constraint (i.e., function's constraint or axiom's
; 'theorem property) by restricted-alist was proved on behalf of the event
; named behalf-of-event-name.  Note that behalf-of-event-name could be 0, e.g.,
; for a verify-guards event.  We arrange that restricted-alist is sorted; see
; the comment in event-responsible-for-proved-constraint.

  (constraint-event-name restricted-alist . behalf-of-event-name)
  t)

; In a nutshell, these records have the following life cycle:
; (1) They are created by hint translation, appealing to the existing value of
;     world global 'proved-functional-instances-alist to prune the list.
; (2) They go into tag-trees when hints are applied; see calls of
;     add-to-tag-tree with tags :use and :by in apply-use-hint-clauses and
;     apply-top-hints-clause1, respectively.
; (3) They are extracted from those tag-trees when events are installed.

; We focus now on (1).  Hint translation creates these records with functions
; translate-use-hint and translate-by-hint.  Translate-use-hint returns an
; object of the form

; (lmi-lst (hyp1 ... hypn) cl k event-names new-entries)

; while translate-by-hint returns an object of the form
;
; (lmi-lst thm-cl-set constraint-cl k event-names new-entries).

; In each case, new-entries is a list of
; proved-functional-instances-alist-entry records created by
; translate-lmi/functional-instance; just follow the call tree down from
; translate-use-hint or translate-by-hint to translate-lmi and then
; translate-lmi/functional-instance.  But following the call tree further, we
; see that new-entries ultimately comes from relevant-constraints, which in
; turn passes along the new-entries created by relevant-constraints1-axioms and
; relevant-constraints1.  These two functions use the already-existing records
; from world global 'proved-functional-instances-alist to prune the set of
; generated constraints (and save the behalf-of-event-name fields justifying
; such pruning for a suitable message -- see the call of tilde-@-lmi-phrase in
; apply-top-hints-clause-msg1).  These same two functions
; (relevant-constraints1-axioms and relevant-constraints1) also return a list
; of new proved-functional-instances-alist-entry records.

; The records created as above are missing the :behalf-of-event-name field
; (i.e., its value is nil), and that is how they go into tag-trees as
; components of values associated with :use and :by tags.  That missing field
; is eventually filled in by
; supply-name-for-proved-functional-instances-alist-entry in
; proved-functional-instances-from-tagged-objects, which is called by
; install-event in order to update world global
; 'proved-functional-instances-alist.

; As with add-event-landmark above, we first update the world index
; and then add the command-landmark.  However, here it is crucial that
; the index be inside the landmark, i.e., that the landmark happen
; last.  Suppose we put the landmark down first and then added the
; index for that landmark.  If we later did a :ubt of the subsequent
; command, we would kill the index entry.  No harm would come then.
; But n commands later we would find the index out of sync with the
; maximum command number.  The problem is that :ubt keys on
; 'command-landmark and we ought to keep them outside everything else.

; The function maybe-add-command-landmark, which ld-loop uses to add
; command-landmarks in response to user commands, relies upon the fact
; that well-formed worlds always contain a command-landmark as their
; first element.

; Defun-Mode is generally the default-defun-mode of the world in which this
; form is being executed.  But there are two possible exceptions.  When we add
; the command landmarks for enter-boot-strap-mode and exit-boot-strap-mode we
; just use the defun-mode :logic.  That happens to be correct for
; exit-boot-strap-mode, but is wrong for enter-boot-strap-mode, which today is

; Ctx is ignored unless we are extending the current ACL2 world, in which case

; maybe-warn-about-theory.

; This is the only way in ACL2 (as opposed to raw Common Lisp) to
; install wrld as the current-acl2-world.  Flg must be either
; 'extension or 'retraction.  Logically speaking, all this function
; does is set the state global value of 'current-acl2-world in state
; to be wrld and possibly set current-package to "ACL2".  Practically,
; speaking however, it installs wrld on the symbol-plists in Common
; Lisp.  However, wrld must be an extension or retraction, as
; indicated, of the currently installed ACL2 world.

; Statement of Policy regarding Erroneous Events and
; Current ACL2 World Installation:

; Any event which causes an error must leave the current-acl2-world of
; state unchanged.  That is, if you extend the world in an event, you
; must revert on error back to the original world.  Once upon a time
; we enforced this rule in LD, simply by reverting the world on every
; erroneous command.  But then we made that behavior conditional on
; the LD special ld-error-triples.  If ld-error-triples is nil, then
; (mv t nil state) is not treated as an error by LD.  Hence, an
; erroneous DEFUN, say, evaluated with ld-error-triples nil, does not
; cause LD to revert.  Therefore, DEFUN must manage the reversion
; itself.

; It is important to use events rather than commands here when certifying or
; including a book.  Otherwise, when make-event expansion extends the world, we
; will have to revert back to the beginning of the most recent top-level
; command and install the world from there.  With a large number of such
; make-event forms, such quadratic behavior could be unfortunate.  And, the
; community book books/make-event/stobj-test.lisp illustrates that if after
; make-event expansion we revert to the beginning of the book being certified,
; we could lose the setting of a stobj in that expansion.

; But really, there seems no point in using command landmarks here (as we
; always did until adding this use of event landmarks in Version_3.1).  After
; all, why back up all the way to a command landmark?  (With a different scheme
; we can imagine a reason; we'll get to that at the end of this long comment.)
; Moreover, if installation of an event were to consult the installed world, it
; would be important that all previous events have already been installed.  For
; example, in the hons version of v3-6-1, the following example caused a hard
; error, as shown and explained below.

; (defun foo (x)
;   (declare (xargs :guard t))
;   (cons x x))
;
; (progn
;   (defun foo-cond (x)
;     (declare (ignore x)
;              (xargs :guard 't))
;     nil)
;   (memoize 'foo :condition-fn 'foo-cond)
;   (progn
;     (deflabel some-label)
;     (defthm non-thm (equal x y))))

; HARD ACL2 ERROR in SCAN-TO-LANDMARK-NUMBER:  We have scanned the world
; looking for absolute event number 6463 and failed to find it....

; How could this have happened?  First note that the cltl-command for memoize
; invoked function cltl-def-from-name, which was looking in the installed world
; for the definition of foo-cond.  But the world containing that 'cltl-command
; had not yet been installed in the state, because extend-world1 only installs
; the world after processing all the new trips.  So when the defthm failed, its
; revert-world-on-error first retracted the world all the way back to just
; after the command for foo (not to just after the deflabel).  The above error
; occurred because the attempt to fetch the cltl definition of foo-cond was
; passed the installed world: the world just after the introduction of foo.
; Now we don't get that error: instead we only roll back to the event landmark
; for the deflabel, and then we back out gracefully.  Actually, we have also
; changed the implementation of memoize to avoid looking in the installed world
; for the cltl definition.  But we still like using event landmarks, which can
; result in a lot less processing of world triples since we are not backing up
; all the way to a command landmark.

; Finally we address the "different scheme" promised above for the use of
; comman landmarks.  In a chat with Sol Swords we came to realize that it would
; likely be more efficient to pop all the way back to the last command, and not
; extend that command world at all.  (Recall that each command is protected by
; ld-read-eval-print.)  For example, with the failure of non-thm above, its
; revert-world-on-error puts us at just after the deflabel; then the
; revert-world-on-error for the inner progn puts us at just after the memoize;
; and finally, the revert-world-on-error of the outer progn puts us just after
; the command introducing foo.  Why not just revert directly to that final
; world?  We could, but the current scheme has stood the test of time as being
; robust and efficient, albeit using command landmarks instead of event
; landmarks (and the latter should help performance rather than hurt it).  But
; here is a more compelling reason not to try such a scheme.  At the time a
; form fails, it is hard to know whether the error really cannot be tolerated
; and should pop us out to the start of the command.  Consider for example
; something like:

;    (progn

; Ignore trans-flg and ev-flg for the moment (or imagine their values are t).
; Then the spec of this function is as follows:

; Uterm is an untranslated term with an output signature of * or (mv * *
; state).  We translate it and eval it under alist (after extending alist with
; state bound to the current state) and return the resulting error triple or
; signal a translate or evaluation error.  We restore the world and certain
; state globals (*protected-system-state-globals*) after the evaluation.

; If trans-flg is nil, we do not translate.  We *assume* uterm is a
; single-threaded translated term with output signature (mv * * state)!

; Ev-flg is either t or nil.  If ev-flg is nil, we are to evaluate uterm only
; if all of its free vars are bound in the evaluation environment.  If ev-flg
; is nil and we find that a free variable of uterm is not bound, we return a
; special error triple, namely (mv t 'wait state) indicating that the caller
; should wait until it can get all the vars bound.  On the other hand, if
; ev-flg is t, it means eval the translated uterm, which will signal an error
; if there is an unbound var.

; Note that we do not evaluate in safe-mode.  Perhaps we should.  However, we
; experimented by timing certification for community books directory
; books/hints/ without and with safe-mode, and found times of 13.5 and 16.4

(defmacro with-ctx-summarized (ctx body)

; A typical use of this macro by an event creating function is:

; (with-ctx-summarized (cons 'defun name)
;   (er-progn ...
;             (er-let* (... (v form) ...)
;             (install-event ...))))

; Note that with-ctx-summarized binds the variables ctx and saved-wrld, which
; thus can be used in body.

; If body changes the installed world then the new world must end with an
; event-landmark (we cause an error otherwise).  The segment of the new world
; back to the previous event-landmark is scanned for redefined names and an
; appropriate warning message is printed, as per ld-redefinition-action.

; The most obvious way to satisfy this restriction on world is for each
; branch through body to (a) stop with stop-redundant-event, (b) signal an
; error, or (c) conclude with install-event.  Two of our current uses of this
; macro do not follow so simple a paradigm.  In include-book-fn we add many
; events (in process-embedded-events) but we do conclude with an install-event
; which couldn't possibly redefine any names because no names are defined in
; the segment from the last embedded event to the landmark for the include-book
; itself.  In certify-book-fn we conclude with an include-book-fn.  So in both
; of those cases the scan for redefined names ends quickly (without going into
; the names possibly redefined in the embedded events) and finds nothing to
; report.

; This macro initializes the timers for an event and then executes the supplied
; body, which should return an error triple.  Whether an error is signalled or
; not, the macro prints the summary and then pass the error triple on up.  The
; stats must be available from the state.  In particular, we print redefinition
; warnings that are recovered from the currently installed world in state and
; we print the runes from 'accumulated-ttree.

; This function is the way to finish off an ACL2 event.  Val is the value to be
; returned by the event (in the standard error flag/val/state three-valued
; result).  Namex is either 0, standing for the empty set of names, an atom,
; standing for the singleton set of names containing that atom, or a true list
; of symbols, standing for the set of names in the list.  Each symbol among
; these names will be given an 'absolute-event-number property.  In addition,
; we set 'event-landmark 'global-value to an appropriate event tuple, thus
; marking the world for this event.  Cltl-cmd is the desired value of the
; 'global-value for 'cltl-command (see below).  Chk-theory-inv-p is generally
; nil, but is non-nil if we are to check theory invariants, and is :PROTECT if
; the call is not already in the scope of a revert-world-on-error.  Wrld is the
; world produced by the ACL2 event and state is the current state, and before
; extending it as indicated above, we extend it if necessary by an appropriate
; record of the proof obligations discharged in support of functional
; instantiation, in order to avoid such proofs in later events.

; Ttree is the final ttree of the event.  We install it as 'accumulated-ttree
; so that the runes reported in the summary are guaranteed to be those of the
; carefully tracked ttree passed along through the proof.  It is possible that
; the 'accumulated-ttree already in state contains junk, e.g., perhaps we
; accumulated some runes from a branch of the proof we have since abandoned.
; We try to avoid this mistake, but just to be sure that a successful proof
; reports the runes that we really believe got used, we do it this way.

; We store the 'absolute-event-number property for each name.  We set
; 'event-landmark.  We store the cltl-cmd as the value of the variable
; 'cltl-command (if cltl-cmd is non-nil).  We update the event index.  We
; install the new world as the current ACL2 world in state.  Non-logical code
; in set-w notes the 'cltl-command requests in the world and executes
; appropriate raw Common Lisp for effect.  This function returns the triple
; indicating a non-erroneous return of val.

; The installation of the world into state causes "secret" side-effects on the
; underlying lisp state, as controlled by 'cltl-command.  Generally, the value
; is a raw lisp form to execute, e.g., (defconst name val).  But when the car
; of the form is DEFUNS the general form is (DEFUNS defun-mode-flg ignorep def1
; ...  defn).  The raw lisp form to execute is actually (DEFUNS def1'
; ... defn'), where the defi' are computed from the defi depending on
; defun-mode-flg and ignorep.  Defun-Mode-flg is either nil (meaning the
; function is :non-executable or the parent event is an encapsulate which is
; trying to define the executable counterparts of the constrained functions) or
; a defun-mode (meaning the parent event is an executable DEFUNS and the
; defun-mode is the defun-mode of the defined functions).  Ignorep is
; 'reclassifying, '(defstobj . stobj-name), or nil.  If ignorep is nil, we add
; each def and its *1* counterpart, after pushing the old bodies on the undo
; stack.  If ignorep is 'reclassifying (which means we are reclassifying a
; :program fn to a :logic fn without changing its definition -- which is
; probably hand coded ACL2 source), we define only the *1* counterparts after
; pushing only the *1* counterparts on the undo stack.  If ignorep is
; '(defstobj . stobj-name) we do not add the def or its *1* counterpart, but we
; do push both the main name and the *1* name.  This is because we know
; defstobj will supply a symbol-function for the main name and its *1*
; counterpart in a moment.  We use the stobj-name in the *1* body to compute
; the stobjs-in of the function.  See the comment in add-trip.

; One might ask why we make add-trip do the oneify to produce the *1* bodies,
; instead of compute them when we generate the CLTL-COMMAND.  The reason is
; that we use the 'cltl-command of a DEFUN as the only place we can recover the
; exact ACL2 defun command that got executed.  (Exception: in the case that the
; :defun-mode is nil, i.e., the definition is non-executable, we have replaced
; the body with a throw-raw-ev-fncall.)

  allowing a name to be introduced ``twice''~/

  Sometimes an event will announce that it is ``redundant'', meaning that the
  the form is not evaluated because ACL2 determines that its effect is already
  incorporated into the logical ~il[world].  Thus, when this happens, no change
  to the logical ~il[world] takes place.  This feature permits two independent
  ~il[books], each of which defines some name, to be included sequentially
  provided they use exactly the same definition.

  Note that by the definition above, a form can have no effect on the logical
  ~il[world] yet not be considered to be redundant.  Here is an example of such
  a form.
  ~bv[]
    (value-triple (cw \"Hello world.~~%\"))
  ~ev[]~/

  When are two ~il[logical-name] definitions considered ``the same''?  It
  depends upon the kind of name being defined.  We consider these below in
  alphabetical order.  See also the Notes below.

  A ~ilc[defabsstobj] is redundant if there is already an identical
  ~c[defabsstobj] event in the logical ~il[world].

  A ~ilc[defattach] event is never redundant.  Note that it doesn't define any
  name.

  A ~ilc[defaxiom] or ~ilc[defthm] event is redundant if there is already an axiom
  or theorem of the given name and both the formula (after
  macroexpansion) and the ~il[rule-classes] are syntactically identical.
  Note that a ~ilc[defaxiom] can make a subsequent ~ilc[defthm] redundant, and a
  ~ilc[defthm] can make a subsequent ~ilc[defaxiom] redundant as well.

  A ~ilc[defconst] is redundant if the name is already defined either with a
  syntactically identical ~c[defconst] event or one that defines it to have the
  same value.

  A ~ilc[defdoc] event is never redundant because it doesn't define any name.

  A ~ilc[deflabel] event is never redundant.  This means that if you have a
  ~ilc[deflabel] in a book and that book has been included (without error),
  then references to that label denote the point in ~il[history] at which
  the book introduced the label.  See the note about shifting logical
  names, below.

  A ~ilc[defmacro] event is redundant if there is already a macro defined with
  the same name and syntactically identical arguments, ~il[guard], and body.

  A ~ilc[defpkg] event is redundant if a package of the same name with exactly
  the same imports has been defined.

  A ~ilc[defstobj] event is redundant if there is already a ~c[defstobj] event
  with the same name that has exactly the same field
  descriptors (~pl[defstobj]), in the same order, and with the same
  ~c[:renaming] value if ~c[:renaming] is supplied for either event.

  A ~ilc[defthm] event is redundant according to the criterion given above in
  the discussion of ~c[defaxiom].

  A ~ilc[deftheory] is never redundant.  The ``natural'' notion of
  equivalent ~ilc[deftheory] forms is that the names and values of the two
  theory expressions are the same.  But since most theory expressions are
  sensitive to the context in which they occur, it seems unlikely to
  us that two ~ilc[deftheory]s coming from two sequentially included ~il[books]
  will ever have the same values.  So we prohibit redundant theory
  definitions.  If you try to define the same theory name twice, you
  will get a ``name in use'' error.

  A ~ilc[defun], ~ilc[defuns], or ~ilc[mutual-recursion] event is redundant if
  for each function to be introduced, there has already been introduced a
  function with the same name, the same formals, and syntactically identical
  ~c[:]~ilc[guard], ~c[:measure], type declarations, ~ilc[stobj]~c[s]
  declarations and ~c[body] (before macroexpansion), and an appropriate
  ~c[mode] (see the ``Note About Appropriate Modes'' below).  Moreover, the
  order of the combined ~c[:]~ilc[guard] and type declarations must be the same
  in both cases.  Exceptions:~nl[]
  (1) If either definition is declared ~c[:non-executable] (~pl[defun-nx]),
  then the two events must be identical.~nl[]
  (2) It is permissible for one definition to have a ~c[:]~il[guard] of ~c[t]
  and the other to have no explicit guard (hence, the guard is implicitly
  ~c[t]).~nl[]
  (3) The ~c[:measure] check is avoided if we are skipping proofs (for example,
  during ~ilc[include-book]), and otherwise, the new definition may have a
  ~c[:measure] of ~c[(:? v1 ... vk)], where ~c[(v1 ... vk)] enumerates the
  variables occurring in the measure stored for the old definition.~nl[]
  (4) If either the old or new event is a ~ilc[mutual-recursion] event, then
  redundancy requires that both are ~ilc[mutual-recursion] events that define
  the same set of function symbols.

  An ~ilc[encapsulate] event is most commonly redundant when a syntactically
  identical ~ilc[encapsulate] has already been executed under the same
  ~ilc[default-defun-mode], ~ilc[default-ruler-extenders], and
  ~ilc[default-verify-guards-eagerness].  The full criterion for redundancy of
  ~c[encapsulate] events is more complex, for example ignoring contents of
  ~ilc[local] ~il[events]; ~pl[redundant-encapsulate].

  An ~ilc[in-theory] event is never redundant.  Note that it doesn't define any
  name.

  An ~ilc[include-book] event is redundant if the book has already been
  included.

  A call of ~ilc[make-event] is never redundant, as its argument is always
  evaluated to obtain the make-event expansion.  However, that expansion may of
  course be redundant.

  A ~ilc[mutual-recursion] event is redundant according to the criteria in the
  discussion above for the case of a ~c[defun] event.

  A ~ilc[progn] event is never redundant: its subsidiary ~il[events] are always
  considered.  Of course, its sub-events may themselves be redundant.  If all
  of its sub-events are redundant ~-[] or more generally, if none of the
  sub-events changes the logical ~il[world] ~-[] then the ~c[progn] event also
  won't change the world.

  A ~ilc[push-untouchable] event is redundant if every name supplied is
  already a member of the corresponding list of untouchable symbols.

  A ~ilc[regenerate-tau-database] event is never redundant.  Note that it
  doesn't define any name.

  A ~ilc[remove-untouchable] event is redundant if no name supplied is
  a member of the corresponding list of untouchable symbols.

  A ~ilc[reset-prehistory] event is redundant if it does not cause any change.

  A ~ilc[set-body] event is redundant if the indicated body is already the
  current body.

  A ~ilc[table] event not define any name.  It is redundant when it sets the
  value already associated with a key of the table, or when it sets an entire
  table (using keyword ~c[:clear]) to its existing value; ~pl[table].

  A ~ilc[verify-guards] event is redundant if the function has already had
  its ~il[guard]s verified.

  ~em[Note About Built-in (Predefined) Functions and Macros:]

  Redundancy is restricted for built-in macros and functions that have special
  raw Lisp code.  Such redundancy is only legal in the context of ~ilc[LOCAL].
  This restriction is needed for soundness, for technical reasons omitted here
  (details may be found in a long comment about redundant-events in source
  function ~c[chk-acceptable-defuns-redundancy]).

  ~em[Note About Appropriate Modes:]

  Suppose a function is being redefined and that the formals, guards, types,
  stobjs, and bodies are identical.  When are the modes (~c[:]~ilc[program]
  or ~c[:]~ilc[logic]) ``appropriate?''  Identical modes are appropriate.
  But what if the old mode was ~c[:program] and the new mode is ~c[:logic]?
  This is appropriate, provided the definition meets the requirements of the
  logical definitional principle.  That is, you may redefine ``redundantly''
  a ~c[:program] mode function as a ~c[:logic] mode function provide the
  measure conjectures can be proved.  This is what ~ilc[verify-termination]
  does.  Now consider the reverse style of redefinition.  Suppose the
  function was defined in ~c[:logic] mode and is being identically redefined
  in ~c[:program] mode.  ACL2 will treat the redefinition as redundant,
  provided the appropriate criteria are met (as though it were in :logic
  mode).

  ~em[Note About Shifting Logical Names:]

  Suppose a book defines a function ~c[fn] and later uses ~c[fn] as a logical
  name in a theory expression.  Consider the value of that theory
  expression in two different sessions.  In session A, the book is
  included in a ~il[world] in which ~c[fn] is not already defined, i.e., in a
  ~il[world] in which the book's definition of ~c[fn] is not redundant.  In
  session B, the book is included in a ~il[world] in which ~c[fn] is already
  identically defined.  In session B, the book's definition of ~c[fn] is
  redundant.  When ~c[fn] is used as a logical name in a theory
  expression, it denotes the point in ~il[history] at which ~c[fn] was
  introduced.  Observe that those points are different in the two
  sessions.  Hence, it is likely that theory expressions involving ~c[fn]
  will have different values in session A than in session B.

  This may adversely affect the user of your book.  For example,
  suppose your book creates a theory via ~ilc[deftheory] that is advertised
  just to contain the names generated by the book.  But suppose you
  compute the theory as the very last event in the book using:
  ~bv[]
    (set-difference-theories (universal-theory :here)
                             (universal-theory fn))
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[fn] is the very first event in the book and happens to be a
  ~ilc[defun] event.  This expression returns the advertised set if ~c[fn] is
  not already defined when the book is included.  But if ~c[fn] were
  previously (identically) defined, the theory is larger than
  advertised.

  The moral of this is simple: when building ~il[books] that other people
  will use, it is best to describe your ~il[theories] in terms of logical
  names that will not shift around when the ~il[books] are included.  The
  best such names are those created by ~ilc[deflabel].

  ~em[Note About Unfortunate Redundancies.]

  Notice that our syntactic criterion for redundancy of ~ilc[defun] ~il[events]
  may not allow redefinition to take effect unless there is a syntactic change
  in the definition.  The following example shows how an attempt to redefine a
  function can fail to make any change.
  ~bv[]
    (set-ld-redefinition-action '(:warn . :overwrite) state)
    (defmacro mac (x) x)
    (defun foo (x) (mac x))
    (defmacro mac (x) (list 'car x))
    (set-ld-redefinition-action nil state)
    (defun foo (x) (mac x)) ; redundant, unfortunately; foo does not change
    (thm (equal (foo 3) 3)) ; succeeds, showing that redef of foo didn't happen
  ~ev[]
  The call of macro ~c[mac] was expanded away before storing the first
  definition of ~c[foo] for the theorem prover.  Therefore, the new definition
  of ~c[mac] does not affect the expansion of ~c[foo] by the theorem prover,
  because the new definition of ~c[foo] is ignored.

  One workaround is first to supply a different definition of ~c[foo], just
  before the last definition of ~c[foo] above.  Then that final definition will
  no longer be redundant.  However, as a courtesy to users, we strengthen the
  redundancy check for function definitions when redefinition is active.  If in
  the example above we remove the form
  ~c[(set-ld-redefinition-action nil state)], then the problem goes away:

  ~bv[]
    (set-ld-redefinition-action '(:warn . :overwrite) state)
    (defmacro mac (x) x)
    (defun foo (x) (mac x))
    (defmacro mac (x) (list 'car x))
    (defun foo (x) (mac x)) ; no longer redundant
    (thm (equal (foo 3) 3)) ; fails, as we would like
  ~ev[]

  To summarize: If a ~ilc[defun] form is submitted that meets the usual
  redundancy criteria, then it may be considered redundant even if a macro
  called in the definition has since been redefined.  The analogous problem
  applie to constants, i.e., symbols defined by ~ilc[defconst] that occur in
  the definition body.  However, if redefinition is currently active the
  problem goes away: that is, the redundancy check is strengthened to check the
  ``translated'' body, in which macro calls and constants defined by
  ~ilc[defconst] are expanded away.

  The above discussion for ~ilc[defun] forms applies to ~ilc[defconst] forms as
  well.  However, for ~ilc[defmacro] forms ACL2 always checks translated
  bodies, so such bogus redundancy does not occur.

  Here is more complex example illustrating the limits of redefinition, based
  on one supplied by Grant Passmore.
  ~bv[]
    (defun n3 () 0)
    (defun n4 () 1)
    (defun n5 () (> (n3) (n4))) ; body is normalized to nil
    (thm (equal (n5) nil)) ; succeeds, trivially
    (set-ld-redefinition-action '(:warn . :overwrite) state)
    (defun n3 () 2)
    (thm (equal (n5) nil)) ; still succeeds, sadly
  ~ev[]
  We may expect the final ~ilc[thm] call to fail because of the following
  reasoning: ~c[(n5)] = ~c[(> (n3) (n4))] = ~c[(> 2 1)] = ~c[t].  Unfortunatly,
  the body of ~c[n5] was simplified (``normalized'') to ~c[nil] when ~c[n5] was
  admitted, so the redefinition of ~c[n3] is ignored during the final ~c[thm]
  call.  (Such normalization can be avoided; see the brief discussion of
  ~c[:normalize] in the documentation for ~ilc[defun].)  So, given this
  unfortunate situation, one might expect at this point simply to redefine
  ~c[n5] using the same definition as before, in order to pick up the new
  definition of ~c[n3].  Such ``redefinition'' would, however, be redundant,
  for the same reason as in the previous example: no syntactic change was made
  to the definition.  Even with redefinition active, there is no change in the
  body of ~c[n5], even with macros and constants (defined by ~ilc[defconst])
  expanded; there are none such!  The same workaround applies as before:
  redefine ~c[n5] to be something different, and then redefine ~c[n5] again to
  be as desired.

  A related phenomenon can occur for ~ilc[encapsulate].  As explained above, an
  ~c[encapsulate] event is redundant if it is identical to one already in the
  database.  (But a weaker condition applies in general;
  ~pl[redundant-encapsulate].)  Consider then the following contrived example.
  ~bv[]
    (defmacro mac (x) x)
    (encapsulate () (defun foo (x) (mac x)))
    (set-ld-redefinition-action '(:warn . :overwrite) state)
    (defmacro mac (x) (list 'car x))
    (encapsulate () (defun foo (x) (mac x)))
  ~ev[]
  The last ~c[encapsulate] event is redundant because it meets the criterion
  for redundancy: it is identical to the earlier ~c[encapsulate] event.  Even
  though redefinition is active, and hence ACL2 ``should'' be able to see that
  the new ~ilc[defun] of ~c[foo] is not truly redundant, nevertheless the
  criterion for redundancy of ~ilc[encapsulate] allows the new ~c[encapsulate]
  form to be redundant.

  A workaround can be to add something trivial to the ~c[encapsulate], for
  example:
  ~bv[]
    (encapsulate ()
      (deflabel try2) ; ``Increment'' to try3 next time, and so on.
      (defun foo (x) x))
  ~ev[]")

; Examining the World

; The user must be given facilities for poking around the world.  To describe
; where in the world he wishes to look, we provide "landmark descriptors."
; A landmark descriptor, lmd, identifies a given landmark in the world.
; It does this by "decoding" to either (COMMAND-LANDMARK . n) or
; (EVENT-LANDMARK . n), where n is an absolute command or event number, as
; appropriate.  Then, using lookup-world-index, one can obtain the
; relevant world.  The language of lmds is designed to let the user
; poke conveniently given the way we have chosen to display worlds.
; Below is a typical display:

; d    1 (DEFUN APP (X Y) ...)
; d    2 (DEFUN REV (X) ...)
;      3 (ENCAPSULATE (((HD *) => *)) ...)
; D       (DEFTHM HD-CONS ...)
; D       (DEFTHM HD-ATOM ...)
;      4 (IN-THEORY #)

; Observe firstly that the commands are always displayed in chronological
; order.

; Observe secondly that user commands are numbered consecutively.  We
; adopt the policy that the commands are numbered from 1 starting with
; the first command after the boot-strap.  Negative integers number
; the commands in "pre-history."  These command numbers are not our
; absolute command numbers.  Indeed, until we have completed the
; boot-strapping we don't know what "relative" command number to
; assign to the chronologically first command in the boot-strap.  We
; therefore internally maintain only absolute command numbers and just
; artificially offset them by a certain baseline when we display them
; to the user.

; The legal command descriptors and their meaning are shown below.  N

; :min   -- the chronologically first command of the boot

; :start -- 0 at startup, but always refers to (exit-boot-strap-mode), even
;           after a reset-prehistory command

; :max   -- the most recently executed command -- synonymous with :x

; n      -- the nth command landmark, as enumerated by relative command
;           numbers

; name   -- the command containing the event that introduced name

; (cd n) -- the command n removed from the one described by cd

; (:search pat cd1 cd2) -- search the interval from cd1 to cd2 for the first
;           command whose form (or one of whose event forms) matches pat.
;           By "match" we mean "contains all of the elements listed".

;           if cd2 > cd1.  The special case (:search pat) means

; Displaying Events and Commands

; When we display an event we will also show the "context" in which
; it occurs, by showing the command block.  The rationale is that
; the user cannot undo back to any random event -- he must always
; undo an entire command block -- and thus our convention serves to
; remind him of what will fall should he undo the displayed event.
; Similarly, when we display a command we will sketch the events in
; its block, to remind him of all the effects of that command.

; The commands in the display will be numbered sequentially.  Command
; 1 will be the first command typed by the user after bootstrap.  Negative
; command numbers refer to prehistoric commands.

; Commands will be displayed in chronological order.  This means we
; must print them in the reverse of the order in which we encounter
; them in the world.  Actually, it is not exactly the reverse, because
; we wish to print commands, encapsulates, and include-books before
; their events, but they are stored on the world after their events.

; Because some events include others it is possible for the user to
; accidentally ask us to print out large blocks, even though the
; interval specified, e.g., commands 1 through 3, is small.  This
; means that a tail recursive implementation is desirable.  (We could
; print in reverse order by printing on the way out of the recursion.)

; Because of all these complications, we have adopted a two pass
; approach to printing out segments of the world.  Both passes are
; tail recursive.  During the first, we collect a list of "landmark
; display directives" (ldd's) and during the second we interpret those
; directives to display the landmarks.  Roughly speaking, each ldd
; corresponds to one line of the display.

; Note to Software Archaeologists of the Future:

; As you study this code, you may wonder why the authors are so
; persistent in inventing long, pompous sounding names, e.g.,
; "landmark display directives" or "prove spec var" and then
; shortening them to unpronounceable letter sequences, e.g., "ldd" and
; "pspv".  This certainly goes against the grain of some software
; scientists who rail against unpronounceable names, acronyms, and
; unnecessary terminology in general.  For the record, we are not
; unsympathetic to their pleas.  However, by adopting these
; conventions we make it easy to use Emacs to find out where these
; objects are documented and manipulated.  Until this code was added
; to the system, the character string "ldd" did not occur in it.  Big
; surprise!  Had we used some perfectly reasonable English word, e.g.,
; "line" (as we might have had we described this code in isolation
; from all other) there would be many false matches.  Of course, we
; could adopt an ordinary word, e.g., "item" that just happened not to
; occur in our sources.  But unfortunately this suffers not only from
; giving a very technical meaning to an ordinary word, but offers no
; protection against the accidental use of the word later in a
; confusing way.  Better, we thought, to come up with the damn
; acronyms which one pretty much has to know about to use.

; In addition to telling us the form to print, an ldd must tell us the
; form to print, whether it is a command or an event, the command
; number, whether it is to be printed in full or only sketched,
; whether it is to be marked, whether it is fully, partially, or not
; disabled, and how far to indent it.

; Now we turn to the problem of assembling lists of ldds.  There are
; currently three different situations in which we do this and rather
; than try to unify them, we write a special-purpose function for
; each.  The three situations are:

; (1) When we wish to print out a sequence of commands:  We print only the
;     commands, not their events, and we only sketch each command.  We
;     mark the endpoints.

; (2) When we wish to print out an entire command block, meaning the
;     command and each of its events: We will print the command in
;     full and marked, and we will only sketch each event.  We will
;     not show any events in the special case that there is only one
;     event and it has the same form as the command.  This function,
;     make-ldd-command-block, is the simplest of our functions that
;     deals with a mixture of commands and events.  It has to crawl
;     over the world, reversing the order (more or less) of the events
;     and taking the command in at the end.

; (3) When we wish to print out an event and its context: This is like
;     case (2) above in that we print a command and its block.  But we
;     only sketch the forms involved, except for the event requested,
;     which we print marked and in full.  To make things monumentally
;     more difficult, we also elide away irrelevant events in the
;     block.

  :pc :x   ; print the most recent command
  :pc fn   ; print the command that introduced fn
  ~ev[]
  ~l[command-descriptor].~/

  ~c[Pc] takes one argument, a ~il[command] descriptor, and prints the ~il[command]
  identified by that descriptor.  ~l[command-descriptor].  For
  example
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>:pc foo
   LVd     52 (DEFUN FOO (X) X)
  ~ev[]
  ~c[Pc] always prints a space first, followed by three (possibly blank)
  ~il[characters] (``LVd'' above) explained below (four, in the experimental
  HONS version, as discussed further below).  Then ~c[pc] prints the
  ~il[command] number, a number uniquely identifying the ~il[command]'s
  position in the sequence of ~il[command]s since the beginning of the user's
  session.  Finally, the ~il[command] itself is printed.

  While ~c[pc] always prints a space first, some ~il[history] ~il[command]s, for
  example ~c[:]~ilc[pcs] and ~c[:]~ilc[pe], use the first column of output to delimit a
  region of ~il[command]s or to point to a particular event within a
  ~il[command].

  For example, ~c[:pcs 52 54] will print something like
  ~bv[]
  /LVd     52 (DEFUN FOO (X) X)
   LV      53 (DEFUN BAR (X) (CONS X X))
  \\        54 (DEFTHM FOO-BAR (EQUAL (CAR (BAR X)) (FOO X)))
            : ...
          127 (DEFUN LATEST (X) X)
  ~ev[]
  Here, the two slash ~il[characters] in the first column are intended to
  suggest a bracket delimiting ~il[command]s 52 through 54.  The last
  ~il[command] printed by ~ilc[pcs] is always the most recent ~il[command], i.e., the
  ~il[command] at ~c[:here], and is separated from the rest of the display by
  an elipsis if some ~il[command]s are omitted.

  Similarly, the ~c[:]~ilc[pe] ~il[command] will print a particular event within a
  ~il[command] block and will indicate that event by printing a ``~ilc[>]'' in
  the first column.  The symbol is intended to be an arrow pointing at
  the event in question.

  For example, ~c[:]~ilc[pe] ~c[true-listp-app] might print:
  ~bv[]
           1 (INCLUDE-BOOK \"list-book\")
              \\
  >           (DEFTHM TRUE-LISTP-APP
                      (EQUAL (TRUE-LISTP (APP A B)) (TRUE-LISTP B)))
  ~ev[]
  using the arrow to indicate the event itself.  The slash printed
  to connect the ~il[command], ~ilc[include-book], with the event, ~ilc[defthm], is
  intended to suggest a tree branch indicating that the event is
  inferior to (and part of) the ~il[command].

  The mysterious ~il[characters] sometimes preceding a ~il[command] have the
  following interpretations.  The first two have to do with the function
  symbols introduced by the ~il[command] and are blank if no symbols were
  introduced.

  At any time we can classify our function symbols into disjoint sets, which we
  will here name with ~il[characters].  The ``~c[P]'' functions are those in
  ~c[:]~ilc[program] mode.  The ``~c[L]'' functions are those in
  ~c[:]~ilc[logic] mode whose ~il[guard]s have not been verified.  The
  ``~c[V]'' functions are those in ~c[:]~ilc[logic] mode whose ~il[guard]s have
  been verified.  You may also see the use of (lower-case) ``~c[v]'' to
  indicate functions introduced by ~ilc[encapsulate].  Note that
  ~ilc[verify-termination] and ~ilc[verify-guards] cause function symbols to be
  reclassified.  If a ~il[command] introduces function symbols then the first
  mysterious character indicates the class of the symbols at the time of
  introduction and the second character indicates the current class of the
  symbols (if the current class is different from the introductory class).

  Thus, the display
  ~bv[]
   PLd     52 (DEFUN FOO (X) X)
  ~ev[]
  tells us that ~il[command] 52 introduced a ~c[:]~ilc[program] function but that
  some ~il[command] after 52 changed its mode to ~c[:]~ilc[logic] and that the
  ~il[guard]s of ~c[foo] have not been verified.  That is, ~c[foo]'s
  termination has been verified even though it was not verified as
  part of the ~il[command] that introduced ~c[foo].  Had a subsequent
  ~il[command] verified the ~il[guard]s of ~c[foo], the display would contain a
  ~c[V] where the ~c[L] is.

  The display
  ~bv[]
   P d     52 (DEFUN FOO (X) X)
  ~ev[]
  indicates that ~c[foo] was introduced in ~c[:]~ilc[program] mode and still
  is in that mode.

  The third character indicates the enabled/disabled status of the
  ~il[rune]s introduced by the ~il[command].  If the status character is blank
  then all the ~il[rune]s (if any) introduced are ~il[enable]d.  If the status
  character is ``~c[D]'' then some ~il[rune]s were introduced and they are
  all ~il[disable]d.  If the status character is ``~c[d]'' then at least
  one, but not all, of the ~il[rune]s introduced is ~il[disable]d.  Thus, in the
  display
  ~bv[]
   L d     52 (DEFUN FOO (X) X)
  ~ev[]
  we see that some ~il[rune] introduced by ~il[command] 52 is ~il[disable]d.  As
  noted in the documentation for ~il[rune], a ~ilc[defun] ~il[command]
  introduces many ~il[rune]s, e.g., the axiomatic definition rule,
  ~c[(:definition fn)], the executable counterpart rule,
  ~c[(:executable-counterpart fn)], and ~il[type-prescription]s,
  ~c[(:type-prescription fn)].  The display above does not say which of
  the ~il[rune]s based on ~c[foo] is ~il[disable]d, but it does tell us one of
  them is; ~pl[disabledp] for how to obtain the disabled runes for
  a given function symbol.

  Finally, for the experimental HONS version only (~pl[hons-and-memoization]),
  a fourth character is printed, indicating whether functions are memoized.
  A symbol may be memoized if it is a function symbol that is not constrained
  (i.e., introduced by ~ilc[defchoose] or in the ~il[signature] of an
  ~ilc[encapsulate] event).  If the command introduces no symbol that may be
  memoized, then a space is printed.  Otherwise, if every memoizable symbol is
  memoized, an ``~c[M]'' is printed.  Otherwise, an ``~c[m]'' is printed.~/"

;   (str :k1 qt1 ... :kn qtn)
; where str is a string suitable for printing with ~@, each :ki is a
; keyword, and each qti is a query tree.  If qt is an atom, it is
; returned.  Otherwise, str is printed and the user is prompted for
; one of the keys.  When ki is typed, we recur on the corresponding
; qti.  Note that the user need not type a keyword, just a symbol
; whose symbol-name is that of one of the keywords.

; Thus, '("Do you want to redefine ~x0?" :y t :n nil) will print
; the question and require a simple y or n answer, returning t or nil
; as appropriate.

; Warning: We don't always actually read an answer!  We sometimes
; default.  Our behavior depends on the LD specials standard-co,
; standard-oi, and ld-query-control-alist, as follows.

; Let x be (cdr (assoc-eq id (ld-query-control-alist state))).  X must
; be either nil, a keyword, or a singleton list containing a keyword.
; If it is a keyword, then it must be one of the keys in (cdr qt) or
; else we cause an error.  If x is a keyword or a one-element list
; containing a keyword, we act as though we read that keyword as the
; answer to our query.  If x is nil, we read *standard-oi* for an
; answer.

; Now what about printing?  Where does the query actually appear?  If
; we get the answer from the control alist, then we print both the
; query and the answer to standard-co, making it simulate an
; interaction -- except, if the control alist gave us a singleton
; list, then we do not do any printing.  If we get the answer from
; *standard-oi* then we print the query to *standard-co*.  In
; addition, if we get the answer from *standard-oi* but *standard-co*
; is not standard-co, we simulate the interaction on standard-co.

  Many different ACL2 entities have names, e.g., functions, macros,
  variables, constants, packages, theorems, ~il[theories], etc.
  Package names are strings.  All other names are symbols and may not
  be in the ~c[\"KEYWORD\"] package.  Moreover, names of functions,
  macros, constrained functions, and constants, other than those that
  are predefined, must not be in the ``main Lisp package'' (which is
  (~c[\"LISP\"] or ~c[\"COMMON-LISP\"], according to whether we are
  following CLTL1 or CLTL2).  An analogous restriction on variables
  is given below.

  ~c[T], ~c[nil], and all names above except those that begin with ampersand
  (&) are names of variables or constants.  ~c[T], ~c[nil], and those names
  beginning and ending with star (*) are constants.  All other such
  names are variables.

  Note that names that start with ampersand, such as ~c[&rest], may be
  lambda list keywords and are reserved for such use whether or not
  they are in the CLTL constant ~c[lambda-list-keywords].  (See pg 82
  of CLTL2.)  That is, these may not be used as variables.  Unlike
  constants, variables may be in the main Lisp package as long as they
  are in the original list of imports from that package to ACL2, the
  list ~c[*common-lisp-symbols-from-main-lisp-package*], and do not
  belong to a list of symbols that are potentially ``global.''  This
  latter list is the value of ~c[*common-lisp-specials-and-constants*].

  Our restrictions pertaining to the main Lisp package take into
  account that some symbols, e.g., ~c[lambda-list-keywords] and
  ~c[boole-c2], are ``special.''  Permitting them to be bound could
  have harmful effects.  In addition, the Common Lisp language does
  not allow certain manipulations with many symbols of that package.
  So, we stay away from them, except for allowing certain variables as
  indicated above.")

  ":Doc-Section Miscellaneous

  to collect the names that have been redefined~/
  ~bv[]
  Example and General Forms:
  (redefined-names state)
  ~ev[]~/

  This function collects names that have been redefined in the current ACL2
  ~il[state].  ~c[:]~ilc[Program] mode functions that were reclassified to
  ~c[:]~ilc[logic] functions are not collected, since such reclassification
  cannot imperil soundness because it is allowed only when the new and old
  definitions are identical.

  Thus, if ~c[(redefined-names state)] returns ~c[nil] then no unsafe
  definitions have been made, regardless of ~ilc[ld-redefinition-action].
  ~l[ld-redefinition-action].

  WARNING: This function does not report names that are not explicitly
  redefined in the current logical ~il[world].  Consider for example:
  ~bv[]
  (encapsulate
   ()
   (defun foo () t)
   (local (defun foo () nil))
   (defthm foo-prop
     (equal (foo) nil)
     :rule-classes nil))
  ~ev[]
  If you attempt to call ~ilc[certify-book] in the resulting world, ACL2 will
  appropriately refuse to do the certification:
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 Error in (CERTIFY-BOOK \"foo\" ...):  At least one command in the
  current ACL2 world was executed while the value of state global variable
  'LD-REDEFINITION-ACTION was not nil:

    (DEFUN FOO NIL T)

  Certification is therefore not allowed in this world.  You can use
  :ubt to undo back through this command; see :DOC ubt.
  ~ev[]
  However, since the local redefinition of ~c[foo] is gone in the certification
  world, ~c[(redefined-names state)] will return ~c[nil].  (Technical aside,
  to be ignored except for those interested in implementation details: ACL2
  inhibits ~c[certify-book] in this example because the definition of ~c[foo]
  is the value of ~c[(global-val 'redef-seen (w state))].)"

  ":Doc-Section Events

  add a ~il[documentation] topic~/
  ~bv[]
  Examples:
  (defdoc interp-section
     \":Doc-Section ...\")~/

  General Form:
  (defdoc name doc-string)
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[name] is a symbol or string to be documented and
  ~ilc[doc-string] is a ~il[documentation] string (~pl[doc-string]).  This
  event adds the ~il[documentation] string for symbol ~c[name] to the
  ~c[:]~ilc[doc] database.  It may also be used to change the ~il[documentation]
  for ~c[name] if ~c[name] already has ~il[documentation].  The difference
  between this event and ~ilc[deflabel] is that, unlike ~ilc[deflabel] (but
  like ~ilc[table]), it does not mark the current ~il[history] with the
  ~c[name].  But like ~ilc[deflabel], ~c[defdoc] ~il[events] are never
  considered redundant (~pl[redundant-events]).

  ~l[deflabel] for a means of attaching a ~il[documentation] string to
  a name that marks the current ~il[history] with that name.  We now
  elaborate further on how ~c[defdoc] may be useful in place of ~ilc[deflabel].

  It is usually sufficient to use ~ilc[deflabel] when you might be tempted
  to use ~c[defdoc].  However, unlike ~ilc[deflabel], ~c[defdoc] does not mark
  the current ~il[history] with ~c[name].  Thus, ~c[defdoc] is useful for
  introducing the ~il[documentation] for a ~ilc[defun] or ~ilc[deftheory] event,
  for example, several ~il[events] before the function or theory is
  actually defined.

  For example, suppose you want to define a theory (using ~ilc[deftheory]).
  You need to prove the lemmas in that theory before executing the
  ~ilc[deftheory] event.  However, it is quite natural to define a
  ~c[:Doc-Section] (~pl[doc-string]) whose name is the name of the
  theory to be defined, and put the ~il[documentation] for that theory's
  lemmas into that ~c[:Doc-Section].  ~c[Defdoc] is ideal for this purpose,
  since it can be used to introduce the ~c[:Doc-Section], followed by the
  lemmas referring to that ~c[:Doc-Section], and finally concluded with a
  ~ilc[deftheory] event of the same name.  If ~ilc[deflabel] were used
  instead of ~c[defdoc], for example, then the ~ilc[deftheory] event would
  be disallowed because the name is already in use by the ~ilc[deflabel]
  event.

  We also imagine that some users will want to use ~c[defdoc] to insert
  the ~il[documentation] for a function under development.  This ~c[defdoc]
  event would be followed by definitions of all the subroutines of
  that function, followed in turn by the function definition itself.

  Any time ~c[defdoc] is used to attach ~il[documentation] to an
  already-documented name, the name must not be attached to a new
  ~c[:Doc-Section].  We make this requirement as a way of avoiding
  loops in the ~il[documentation] tree.  When ~il[documentation] is redefined, a
  warning will be printed to the terminal.~/"

; Examples of links are as follows.

; ~L (ordinary link)
; ~L[arg] prints ``See :DOC arg'' to the terminal, and something
;     analogous in other settings (but possibly with a link established,
;     or in the case of printed text, with a reference to a page number
;     and a section).
; Example:  ~l[program] for how to do rapid prototyping.
; -- Prints to the terminal as
;     See :DOC program for how to do rapid prototyping.
; -- A printed version might look more like:
;     See :DOC program, Section 1.3, page 92 for how to do rapid prototyping.
; -- Could print to emacs info as something like:
;     *See program:: for how to do rapid prototyping.

; ~PL (parenthetical link)
; ~pl[arg] prints ``see :DOC arg'' (just like ~l, but with lower-case ``see'')
;      to the terminal; as with ~l, it may establish a link in other settings.
;      The name ``parenthetical'' is taken from texinfo, which claims to
;      require that, unlike the other kind of link, commas and periods may not
;      appear immediately afterwards.  For now, we ignore this issue,
;      considering that ~pl is distinguished from ~l mainly by the case of
;      ``see''.

; ~IL (invisible link):  use the word normally and do not draw any special
;                        attention to the fact that it is a link.
; ~IL[arg] prints ``arg''

; The following association list maps each such directive (as a
; case-insensitive string) to a flag and fmt message, i.e., to a string
; followed by an association list appropriate for that string.  The flag
; determines whether the first part of arg is to be read as a symbol as when it
; represents the name of a link.  When flag=t, we split the arg into two parts,
; the symbol and the text.  A flag of t is used on those keys which translate
; into HREF links in HTML so that the first of the two args is treated as the
; doc topic identifying the link and the rest is treated as the mouse-sensitive
; button text highlighted by HTML.  (Note that even in the terminal and tex
; markup tables we must use flag t on those keys so that those commands get
; only the first doc topic part of the arg.)  The string corresponding to key
; will ultimately be printed in place of the ~key[arg] expression, except that
; the corresponding alist will first be extended by mapping #\a to the (first
; part of the) string arg, and mapping #\A to the upper-casing of that string,
; and #\t to the second part of the string arg (provided flag=t).  Note also
; that the (doc-char-subst-table state) is used to control the substitution of
; sequences of characters for single characters, both in the arg portion of
; ~key[arg] and in characters not part of such expressions, but *not* in the
; key.  To escape a character from substitution by that table, precede it by a
; ~.

; Finally, note that in ~key[arg] we do not allow newline characters.  That is
; because they will not get printed appropriately to the terminal.  Thus, ~c
; may have to be used more than we'd like.  If we really want to include a
; newline for some reason, it should be escaped with ~.

  ":Doc-Section Documentation

  a ~il[markup] table used for printing to the terminal~/

  The value of the ACL2 constant ~c[*terminal-markup-table*] is an association
  list pairing ~il[markup] keys with strings, to be used for printing to the
  terminal.  ~l[markup] for a description of the ACL2 ~il[markup] language.~/

  The entries in ~c[*terminal-markup-table*] are of the form
  ~bv[]
  (key flag . fmt-string)
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[key] is one of the ~il[doc-string] tilde directives (~pl[markup]),
  ~c[flag] is a Boolean as described below, and ~c[fmt-string] is a string as
  expected by the ACL2 printing function ~ilc[fmt].  The system arranges that
  for any ~c[arg], when an expression ~~key[arg] is encountered by the
  ~il[documentation] printer, ~ilc[fmt] will print ~c[fmt-string] in an
  association list, binding keys based on ~c[arg] as follows.
  ~bv[]
  #\\p ~-[] the `pointer'     ; only used if flag is t
  #\\s ~-[] the print name version of the pointer, e.g., |abc| or ABC
  #\\c ~-[] the parent file   ; only used if flag is t
  #\\t ~-[] the displayed text
  #\\T ~-[] uppercased displayed text
  ~ev[]
  The first three entries are used only when the ~c[flag] associated with
  ~c[key] is ~c[t], indicating that the argument ~c[arg] of ~c[~~key] is to be
  parsed as starting with a symbol; for example, ~c[~~key[foo bar~]] will bind
  ~c[#\\p] to the symbol ~c[FOO].

  The discussion of the above association list for printing ~c[fmt-string]
  applies when printing ~il[documentation] to other than the terminal as well.
  Such tools exist for Texinfo and for HTML; see files
  ~c[doc/write-acl2-html.lisp] and ~c[doc/write-acl2-texinfo.lisp] distributed
  with ACL2.")

; Warning: Keep this in sync with missing-fmt-alist-chars.

; Consider a tilde-directive ~?[str].  From str we create a fmt alist that is
; used while we print the string associated with ? in the markup table.  This
; function creates that fmt alist from str and the flag which indicates whether
; the first part of str is to be read as a symbol, as in ~il[defun Definition],
; or not as in ~c[this Definition].

; What are the symbols in the fmt alist we need?  To find the answer, look in
; the markup table and collect all the fmt vars used.  They are:

; #\p -- the "pointer"     ; only used if flag is t
; #\s -- the print name version of the pointer, e.g., |abc| or ABC
; #\c -- the parent file   ; only used if flag is t
; #\t -- the displayed text
; #\T -- uppercased displayed text
; #\w -- the html anchor for the warning message ; only used on ~WARN[]

; The entries marked "only used if flag is t" are not necessarily used if flag
; is t.  For example, the entries in *terminal-markup-table* do not refer to
; #\c, since terminal documentation has no reason to refer to a "parent file".

; If flag is nil, then we bind just the last three.  In this case, the
; displayed text is all of str.

; If flag is t, then we first ``read'' a symbol from str, effectively splitting
; str into two parts, sym and text.  The split is indicated below.  Note that
; sym is a string, not really a symbol.  The "pointer" is the symbol-name of
; sym.  The "print name of the pointer" is the symbol-name of sym possibly
; surrounded by vertical bars.

;    str             #\p    #\s     #\t

; ~?[abc]           "ABC"  "ABC"    "abc"
; ~?[abc ]          "ABC"  "ABC"    ""
; ~?[abc def ghi]   "ABC"  "ABC"    "def ghi"

; Parameter ln is a bit complicated, so we describe it in some detail.

; First suppose that ln is a number, in which case it is the number of lines
; printed so far.  In this case, we do :more processing until we hit the line
; maximum (at which point we save the more-doc-state to continue) or the
; tilde-slash (at which point we set the more-doc-state to nil).

; When ln is nil, we do not bother to track the number of lines printed and we
; print them all up to the tilde-slash, but we then initialize the
; more-doc-state.  The nil setting should be used when you are printing out
; parts 0 or 1 of the doc string.

; When ln is t we behave as for nil, except that we set the more-doc-state to
; nil (as we would for numeric ln) when we hit the tilde-slash.  This setting
; is used when we want to dump the entire part 2.

; When ln is :par, then two consecutive newlines, together with all consecutive
; whitespace characters following them, are handled by printing using the entry
; for EPAR in markup-table, if there is one; else, by using the entry for PAR
; if there is one; else, without such special paragraph treatment.  In the case
; that EPAR's entry is used, then if there are any remaining characters after
; the block of newlines, the entry for BPAR is then printed.

; The final legal value of ln is :par-off, whose purpose is to avoid printing
; paragraph markers when inside certain preformatted (verbatim) environments,
; typically ~bv/~ev and ~bf/~ev for printing to html and the like (but not the
; terminal or texinfo).  Thus, :par-off is treated like :par except that there
; is no special treatment in the case of consecutive newlines.  Thus :par-off
; is really treated lke t, except that ln becomes :par in recursive calls when
; the end of a preformatted environment is encountered.  The argument vp
; (verbatim pair) never changes, and is nil when ln is not :par or :par-off.
; But vp is a pair (begin-markers . end-markers), for example, (("BV" "BF")
; . ("EV" "EF")), where begin-markers tell us to change ln from :par to
; :par-off and end-markers tell us to change ln from :par-off to :par.

; A precondition for this function is that if ln is :par or :par-off and if
; "EPAR" is bound in markup-table (and hence so is "BPAR"), then the
; begin-paragraph marker (as per "BPAR") has already been printed and the
; end-paragraph marker (as per "EPAR") will be printed.  Informatlly, then, it
; is an invariant of this function that at every call in the case that ln is
; :par or :par-off, an end-paragraph marker is pending.

; Str is a doc string and i is a part number, 0, 1, or 2.  We print the ith
; part of the string to channel.  We embed non-empty part 1's between a pair of
; newlines.

; When ln is :par, we interpret two consecutive blank lines as calling for a
; paragraph marker, in the sense described in the comments in
; print-doc-string-part1.  When ln is t, we print the entire part; see
; print-doc-string-part1.  Note that ln is ignored when i is 0.

; We return (mv new-ln state), where new-ln is the final value of ln.  Normally
; we will not need new-ln, but it is useful when printing part 1 followed by
; part 2 in the case that a preformatted environment spans the two parts, e.g.,
; "~bv[]...~/...~ev[]".  Typically we find this with "Example Forms" followed
; by "General Form".  We use the new-ln value in file doc/write-acl2-html.lisp,
; function write-a-doc-section (as of 1/12/2011).

  ~bv[]
  Example:
  ACL2 !>:more
  ~ev[]
  will continue printing whatever ~il[documentation] was started by ~c[:]~ilc[doc]
  or ~c[:]~ilc[more-doc].~/

  When you type ~c[:doc name], for some documented ~c[name], the system
  responds by typing the one-liner and the notes sections of the
  ~il[documentation] for ~c[name].  It then types
``~c[(type :more for more, :more! for the rest)]''.  If you then type
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>:more
  ~ev[]
  the system will start to print the details section of ~c[name].  The
  same thing could be achieved by typing ~c[:more-doc name], but that
  requires you to type name again.

  Similarly, if you have typed ~c[:]~ilc[more-doc] name, the system will print
  the first ``block'' of the details section and then print
  ``~c[(type :more for more, :more! for the rest)]''.  Typing ~c[:more] at that
  point will cause the next block of the details section to be printed.
  Eventually ~c[:more] will conclude by printing ``~c[*-]'' which is the
  indicator that the text has been exhausted.

  What is a ``block'' of text?  ~c[:More] looks for the end of a paragraph
  (two adjacent newlines) after printing ~c[n] lines.  If it doesn't find
  one before it has printed ~c[k] lines, it just stops there.  ~c[N] and ~c[k]
  here are the values of the two ~il[state] global variables
  ~c['more-doc-min-lines] and ~c['more-doc-max-lines].  You may use ~ilc[@] and
  ~ilc[assign] to inspect and set these variables, e.g.,
  ~c[(@ more-doc-max-lines)] will return the current maximum number of
  lines printed by ~c[:more] and ~c[(assign more-doc-max-lines 19)] will
  set it to 19.  On terminals having only 24 lines, we find min and
  max settings of 12 and 19 the most pleasant.

  If you want ~c[:more] to print all of the details instead of feeding
  them to you one block at a time, type ~c[:]~ilc[more!] instead."

  ":Doc-Section Documentation

  the markup language for ACL2 ~il[documentation] strings~/

  ACL2 ~il[documentation] strings make special use of the tilde character
  (~~).  In particular, we describe here a ``markup language'' for
  which the tilde character plays a special role.  The markup language
  is valuable if you want to write ~il[documentation] that is to be
  displayed outside your ACL2 session.  If you are not writing such
  ~il[documentation], and if also you do not use the character `~~', then
  there is no need to read on.~/

  Three uses of the tilde character (~~) in ~il[documentation] strings are
  as follows.  Below we explain the uses that constitute the ACL2
  markup language.
  ~bq[]
  ~c[~~/]~nl[]
  Indicates the end of a documentation ~st[section];
  ~pl[doc-string].

  ~c[~~~~]~nl[]
  Indicates the literal insertion of a tilde character (~~).

  ~c[~~~]]~nl[]
  This directive in a documentation string is effective only during
  the processing of part 2, the details (~pl[doc-string]), and
  controls how much is shown on each round of ~c[:]~ilc[more] processing when
  printing to the terminal.  If the system is not doing ~c[:]~ilc[more]
  processing, then it acts as though the ~~] is not present.
  Otherwise, the system put out a newline and halts documentation
  printing on the present topic, which can be resumed if the user
  types ~c[:]~ilc[more] at the terminal.
  ~eq[]
  The other uses of the tilde character are of the following form.
  ~bv[]
    ~~key[arg]
  ~ev[]
  Before launching into an explanation of how this works in detail,
  let us consider some small examples.

  Here is a word that is code:
  ~bv[]
    ~~c[function-name].
  ~ev[]
  Here is a phrase with an ``emphasized'' word, ``not'':
  ~bv[]
    Do ~~em[not] do that.
  ~ev[]
  Here is the same phrase, but where ``not'' receives stronger
  emphasis (presumably boldface in a printed version):
  ~bv[]
    Do ~~st[not] do that.
  ~ev[]
  Here is a passage that is set off as a display, in a fixed-width
  font:
  ~bv[]
    ~~bv[]
    This passage has been set off as ``verbatim''.
    The present line starts just after a line break.  Normally, printed
    text is formatted, but inside ~~bv[]...~~ev[], line breaks are taken
    literally.
    ~~ev[]
  ~ev[]
  In general, the idea is to provide a ``markup language'' that can be
  reasonably interpreted not only at the terminal (via ~c[:]~ilc[doc]), but
  also via translators into other languages.  In fact, translators
  have been written into Texinfo and HTML.

  Let us turn to a more systematic consideration of how to mark text
  in ~il[documentation] strings using expressions of the form
  ~c[~~key[arg~]], which we will call ``~il[doc-string] tilde directives.''
  The idea is that ~c[key] informs the ~il[documentation] printer (which
  could be the terminal, a hardcopy printer, or some hypertext tool)
  about the ``style'' used to display ~c[arg].  The intention is that
  each such printer should do the best it can.  For example, we have
  seen above that ~c[~~em[arg~]] tells the printer to ~i[emphasize]
  ~c[arg] if possible, using an appropriate display to indicate
  emphasis (italics, or perhaps surrounding ~c[arg] with some character
  like ~c[_], or ...).  For another example, the directive for bold
  font, ~c[~~b[arg~]], says that printed text for ~c[arg] should be in
  bold if possible, but if there is no bold font available (such as at
  the terminal), then the argument should be printed in some other
  reasonable manner (for example, as ordinary text).  The ~c[key] part
  is case-insensitive; for example, you can use ~~BV[] or ~~Bv[] or ~~bV[] in
  place of ~~bv[].

  Every form below may have any string as the argument (inside
  ~c[[..~]]), as long as it does not contain a newline (more on that
  below).  However, when an argument does not make much sense to us,
  we show it below as the empty string, e.g., ``~c[~~bv[~]]'' rather
  than ``~c[~~bv[arg~]]''.
  ~bv[]
  ~~-[]      Print the equivalent of a dash

  ~~b[arg]   Print the argument in bold font, if available

  ~~bid[arg]   ``Begin implementation dependent'' -- Ignores argument at
            terminal.

  ~~bf[]     Begin formatted text (respecting spaces and line breaks),
            but in ordinary font (rather than, say, fixed-width font)
            if possible

  ~~bq[]     Begin quotation (indented text, if possible)

  ~~bv[]     Begin verbatim (print in fixed-width font, respecting
            spaces and line breaks)

  ~~c[arg]   Print arg as ``code'', such as in a fixed-width font

  ~~ef[]     End format; balances ~~bf[]

  ~~eid[arg]   ``End implementation dependent'' -- Ignores argument at
            terminal.

  ~~em[arg]  Emphasize arg, perhaps using italics

  ~~eq[]     End quotation; balances ~~bq[]

  ~~ev[]     End verbatim; balances ~~bv[]

  ~~i[arg]   Print arg in italics font

  ~~id[arg]   ``Implementation dependent'' -- Ignores argument at
            terminal.

  ~~il[arg]  Print argument as is, but make it a link to another doc
            topic (for true hypertext environments).  Note that the
            link argument must match the package name for the desired
            topic unless the package name is ``ACL2''.  That is, to
            link to documentation on ``foo::topic'', one needs to use
            the full name for ``foo::topic'', including its package
            name.

  ~~ilc[arg] Same as ~~il[arg], except that arg should be printed as
            with ~~c[arg]

  ~~l[arg]   Ordinary link to another doc topic; prints as ``See :DOC
            arg'' at the terminal (but also see ~~pl below, which puts
            ``see'' in lower case)

  ~~nl[]     Print a newline

  ~~par[]    Paragraph mark, of no significance at the terminal
            (can be safely ignored; see also notes below)

  ~~pl[arg]  Parenthetical link (borrowing from Texinfo):  same as
            ~~l[arg], except that ``see'' is in lower case.  This is
            typically used at other than the beginning of a sentence.

  ~~sc[arg]  Print arg in (small, if possible) capital letters

  ~~st[arg]  Strongly emphasize arg, perhaps using a bold font

  ~~t[arg]   Typewriter font; similar to ~~c[arg], but leaves less
            doubt about the font that will be used.

  ~~terminal[arg]  Terminal only; arg is to be ignored except when
            reading documentation at the terminal, using :DOC.

  ~~url[arg]  Print arg as HTML hyperlink if possible (else print like ~c[~~c])
  ~ev[]

  ~em[Style notes and further details]

  It is not a good idea to put ~il[doc-string] tilde directives inside
  verbatim environments, ~c[~~bv[~] ... ~~ev[~]].

  Do not nest ~il[doc-string] tilde directives; that is, do not write
  ~bv[]
    The ~~c[~~il[append~]] function ...
  ~ev[]
  but note that the ``equivalent'' expression
  ~bv[]
    The ~~ilc[append] function ...
  ~ev[]
  is fine.  The following phrase is also acceptable:
  ~bf[]
    ~~bf[]This is
    ~~em[formatted] text.
    ~~ef[]
  ~ef[]
  because the nesting is only conceptual, not literal.

  We recommend that for displayed text, ~c[~~bv[~]] and ~c[~~ev[~]]
  should usually each be on lines by themselves.  That way, printed
  text may be less encumbered with excessive blank lines.  Here is an
  example.
  ~bf[]
    Here is some normal text.  Now start a display:
    ~~bv[]
      2 + 2 = 4
    ~~ev[]
    And here is the end of that paragraph.

    Here is the start of the next paragraph.
  ~ef[]
  The analogous consideration applies to ~c[~~bf[~]] and ~c[~~ef[~]] as
  well as ~c[~~bq[~]] and ~c[~~eq[~]].

  You may ``quote'' ~il[characters] inside the ~c[arg] part of
  ~c[~~key[arg~]], by preceding them with ~~.  This is, in fact, the
  only legal way to use a newline character or a right bracket (])
  inside the argument to a ~il[doc-string] tilde directive.

  Write your ~il[documentation] strings without hyphens.  Otherwise, you
  may find your text printed on paper (via TeX, for example) like
  this ~-[]
  ~bf[]
    Here is a hyphe- nated word.
  ~ef[]
  even if what you had in mind was:
  ~bf[]
    Here is a hyphe-
    nated word.
  ~ef[]
  When you want to use a dash (as opposed to a hyphen), consider using
  ~~-[], which is intended to be interpreted as a ``dash.''  For
  example:
  ~bf[]
    This sentence ~~-[] which is broken with dashes ~~-[] is boring.
  ~ef[]
  would be written to the terminal (using ~c[:]~ilc[doc]) by replacing
  ~c[~~-[~]] with two hyphen ~il[characters], but would presumably be
  printed on paper with a dash.

  Be careful to balance the ``begin'' and ``end'' pairs, such as
  ~c[~~bv[~]] and ~c[~~ev[~]].  Also, do not use two ``begin''
  directives (~c[~~bf[~]], ~c[~~bq[~]], or ~c[~~bv[~]]) without an
  intervening ``end'' directive.  It is permissible (and perhaps this
  is not surprising) to use the ~il[doc-string] part separator ~c[~~/] while
  between such a begin-end pair.

  Because of a bug in texinfo (as of this writing), you may wish to
  avoid beginning a line with (any number of spaces followed by) the
  ~ilc[-] character or ~c[~~-[~]].

  The ``paragraph'' directive, ~c[~~par[~]], is rarely if ever used.
  There is a low-level capability, not presently documented, that
  interprets two successive newlines as though they were ~c[~~par[~]].
  This is useful for the HTML driver.  For further details, see the
  authors of ACL2.

  Emacs code is available for manipulating ~il[documentation] strings that
  contain ~il[doc-string] tilde-directives (for example, for doing a
  reasonable job filling such ~il[documentation] strings).  See the authors
  if you are interested.

  We tend to use ~c[~~em[arg~]] for ``section headers,'' such as
  ``Style notes and further details'' above.  We tend to use
  ~c[~~st[arg~]] for emphasis of words inside text.  This division
  seems to work well for our Texinfo driver.  Note that ~c[~~st[arg~]]
  causes ~c[arg] to be printed in upper-case at the terminal (using
  ~c[:]~ilc[doc]), while ~c[~~em[arg~]] causes ~c[arg] to be printed at the
  terminal as though ~c[arg] were not marked for emphasis.

  Our Texinfo and HTML drivers both take advantage of capabilities for
  indicating which ~il[characters] need to be ``escaped,'' and how.  Unless
  you intend to write your own driver, you probably do not need to
  know more about this issue; otherwise, contact the ACL2 authors.  We
  should probably mention, however, that Texinfo makes the following
  requirement:  when using ~c[~~l[arg~]], where ~c[arg] contains
  one of the special ~il[characters] ~ilc[@], ~c[{], or ~c[}], you must
  immediately follow this use with a period or comma.  Also, the Emacs
  ``info'' ~il[documentation] that we generate by using our Texinfo driver
  has the property that in node names, ~c[:] has been replaced by ~c[|]
  (because of quirks in info); so for example, the ``~il[proof-checker]''
  simplification command, ~c[s], is documented under ~c[acl2-pc||s]
  rather than under ~c[acl2-pc::s].

  We have tried to keep this markup language fairly simple; in
  particular, there is no way to refer to a link by other than the
  actual name.  So for example, when we want to make ~c[:]~ilc[doc] an
  invisible link in ``code'' font, we write the following form, which
  indicates that ~c[:] should be in that font and then ~ilc[doc] should
  both be in that font and be an invisible link.

  formatting information (such as fonts and displayed text) in
  ~il[documentation] strings.~/

  ACL2 attaches special importance to ~il[documentation] strings beginning
  with the header ``~c[:Doc-Section]'' (or any variant thereof obtained by
  changing case).  Any ~il[documentation] string that does not begin with
  such a header is considered unformatted and is ignored.  For the
  rest of this discussion, we use the phrase ``~il[documentation] string''
  as though it read ``formatted ~il[documentation] string.''

  ~il[Documentation] strings are always processed in the context of some
  symbol, ~c[name], being defined.  (Indeed, if an event defines no symbol,
  e.g., ~ilc[verify-guards] or ~ilc[in-theory], then it is not permitted to
  have a formatted ~il[documentation] string.)  The string will be associated
  with name in the ``~il[documentation] database.'' The database is divided
  into ``sections'' and each section is named by a symbol.  Among the sections
  are ~ilc[events], ~ilc[documentation], ~ilc[history], ~ilc[other], and
  ~ilc[miscellaneous].  A complete list of the sections may be obtained by
  typing ~c[:docs *] at the terminal.  You can create new sections.  The main
  purpose of sections is simply to partition the large set of names into
  smaller subsets whose contents can be enumerated separately.  The idea is
  that the user may remember (or recognize) the relevant section name and then
  read its contents to find interesting items.

  Within a section are ``~il[documentation] tuples'' which associate with
  each documented name its ~il[documentation] string and a list of related
  documented names, called the ``related names'' of the name.  When
  ~c[:]~ilc[doc] prints the ~il[documentation] for name, it always lists the related
  names.

  When a formatted ~il[documentation] string is submitted with the defining
  event of some name, the section name and an initial set of related
  names are parsed from the string.  In addition, the formatted string
  contains various ``levels'' of detail that are printed out at
  different times.  Finally, it is possible for a string to cause the
  newly documented name to be added to the related names of any
  previously documented name.  Thus, as new names are introduced they
  can be grouped with old ones.

  The general form of an ACL2 formatted ~il[documentation] string is
  ~bv[]
  \":DOC-SECTION <section-name>
    <one-liner>~~/
    <notes>~~/
    <details>~~/
    :CITE <n1>
    ...
    :CITE <nn>
    :CITED-BY <m1>
    ...
    :CITED-BY <mm>\"
  ~ev[]
  Before we explain this, let it be noted that
  ~c[(get-doc-string name state)] will return the ~il[documentation] string
  associated with ~c[name] in the ~il[documentation] database.  You may
  want to call ~c[get-doc-string] on ~c[']~ilc[pe] and ~c[']~ilc[union-theories] just
  to see some concrete ~il[documentation] strings.  This ~il[documentation]
  string, which is rather long, is under ~c['doc-string].

  A formatted ~il[documentation] string has five parts: the header and
  section-name (terminating in the first ~c[#\\Newline]), the ~c[<one-liner>],
  ~c[<notes>], and ~c[<details>] (each terminating in a tilde-slash (``~c[~~/]'')
  pair), and a citation part.  These five parts are parsed into six
  components.  ~c[<section-name>] is read as the name of a symbol,
  section-name.  ~c[<one-liner>], ~c[<notes>], and ~c[<details>] are arbitrary
  sequences of ~il[characters] (ignoring initial white space and not
  including the tilde-slash pairs which terminate them).  The ~c[<ni>] are
  read as symbols and assembled into a list called the ``cite''
  symbols.  The ~c[<mi>] are read as symbols and assembled into a list
  called the ``cited-by'' symbols.  See the warning below regarding
  the hackish nature of our symbol reader.

  ~c[Section-name] must either be a previously documented symbol or else
  be ~c[name], the symbol being documented.  To open a new section of the
  database, named ~c[section-name], you should define the logical name
  section-name (as by ~ilc[deflabel] or any other event; also
  ~pl[defdoc]) and attach to it a ~il[documentation] string for section
  section-name.  You might wish to print out the ~il[documentation] string
  we use for some of our section names, e.g.,
  ~c[(get-doc-string 'events state)].  By forcing section names to be
  documented symbols, we permit sections themselves to have one line
  descriptions and discussions, presented by the standard
  ~il[documentation] facilities like the facilities ~c[:]~ilc[doc] and ~c[:]~ilc[more-doc] that
  may be used at the terminal.

  Each of the ~c[ni]'s and ~c[mi]'s must be previously documented symbols.

  Both ~c[<one-liner>] and ~c[<details>] must be non-empty, i.e., must contain
  some non-whitespace ~il[characters].  ~c[<notes>] may be empty.  The ~c[:cite]s
  and ~c[:cited-by]s pairs may be intermingled and may be separated by
  either newlines or spaces.  The citation part may be empty.  When
  the citation part is empty, the tilde-slash pair terminating the
  ~c[<details>] part may be omitted.  Thus, the simplest form of a
  formatted ~il[documentation] string is:
  ~bv[]
  \":Doc-Section <section-name>
   <one-liner>~~/~~/
   <details>\"
  ~ev[]
  Since white space at the front of ~c[<one-liner>], ~c[<notes>] and
  ~c[<details>] is ignored, we often precede those parts by ~c[#\\Newline]s to
  make the strings easier to read in our source files.  We also
  typically indent all of the text in the string by starting each line
  with a few spaces.  (The Emacs commands for formatting Lisp get
  confused if you have arbitrary ~il[characters] on the left margin.)  We
  assume that every line in ~c[<one-liner>], ~c[<notes>], and ~c[<details>] starts
  with at least as many spaces as ~c[<one-liner>] does, i.e., we assume
  they are all indented the same amount (or more).  Let ~c[d] be the
  number of spaces separating ~c[<one-liner>] from the ~c[#\\Newline]
  preceding it.  When the various parts are printed, we ``de-indent''
  by stripping out the first d spaces following each ~c[#\\Newline].

  However, we find that when ~il[documentation] is printed flush against
  the left margin it is difficult to distinguish the ~il[documentation]
  text from previous output.  We therefore prefix each line we print
  by a special pad of ~il[characters].  By default, this pad is ``~c[| ]'' so
  that ~il[documentation] text has a vertical bar running down the left
  margin.  But the pad is just the value of the global variable
  ~c[doc-prefix] and you may ~ilc[assign] it any string you wish.

  To add such a string to the database under the symbol ~c[name] we make
  a new entry in the section-name section of the database.  The entry
  associates ~c[name] with the string and uses the string's cites list as
  the initial value of the related names field.  In addition, we add
  ~c[name] to the related names field of each of the names listed in the
  string's cited-by list.  We also add ~c[name] to the related names field
  of its section-name.  Observe that the cites list in a string is
  only the initial value of the related names of the names.  Future
  ~il[documentation] strings may add to it via ~c[:cited-by] or ~c[:Doc-Section].
  Indeed, this is generally the case.  We discuss this further below.

  When a brief description of ~c[name] is required (as by ~c[:docs **]), ~c[name]
  and ~c[<one-liner>] are printed.  ~c[<one-liner>] is usually printed
  starting in column 15 (however ~pl[print-doc-start-column]).
  Despite its name, ~c[<one-liner>] need not be one line.  It usually is
  one line, however.

  When you type ~c[:]~ilc[doc] name at the terminal, the first response will be
  to print ~c[name] and ~c[<one-liner>].  Then ~c[:]~ilc[doc] prints ~c[<notes>], if any.
  Then, if ~c[name] is the name of a section, it prints the ~c[<one-liner>]s
  for each of its related names.  For example, try ~c[:doc events].  If
  ~c[name] is not a section name but does have some related names, they
  are merely listed but not explained.  Try ~c[:doc theory-functions].
  ~c[:more-doc name] prints ~c[<details>].

  Our style is to let each new concept add itself to the related names
  of old concepts.  To do otherwise increases the chances that
  ~il[documentation] gets outdated because one often forgets to update
  supposedly complete lists of the relevant topics when new topics are
  invented.  For example, ~c[:doc theory-functions] lists each available
  theory function.  But ~c[get-doc-string] of ~c[']~ilc[theory-functions] just
  shows a few examples and has an empty cites list.  From where do we
  get the names of the theory functions listed by ~c[:]~ilc[doc]?  The answer is
  that each theory function has its own ~il[documentation] string and those
  strings each specify ~c[:cited-by] ~il[theory-functions].  See for example
  ~c[get-doc-string] of ~c[']~ilc[union-theories].  So by the time the entire system
  is assembled, the related names of ~c[']~ilc[theory-functions] contains all
  the (documented) theory functions.  This makes it easy to add new
  theory functions without changing the general discussion in
  ~c[']~ilc[theory-functions].

  When an event or ~il[command] form is printed, as by ~c[:]~ilc[pe] or ~c[:]~ilc[pc], that
  contains a formatted ~il[documentation] string, we do not print the
  actual ~il[documentation] string (since they are usually large and
  distracting).  Instead we print the string:
  ~bv[]
    \"Documentation available via :doc\"
  ~ev[]
  inviting you to use ~c[:]~ilc[doc] and ~c[:]~ilc[more-doc] (or ~c[get-doc-string]) if you
  wish to see the ~il[documentation] at the terminal.

  ~em[Warning on Reading Symbols from Strings:] When we read a symbol, such
  as the section-symbol, from a ~il[documentation] string, we use a quick
  and dirty imitation of the much more powerful CLTL ~c[read] program.  In
  particular, we scan past any whitespace, collect all the ~il[characters]
  we see until we get to more whitespace or the end of the string,
  convert the ~il[characters] to upper case, make a string out of them, and
  ~ilc[intern] that string.  Thus, if you typed ~c[\":Doc-Section 123 ...\"] we
  would read the ~c[123] as the symbol ~c[|123|].  Observe that special
  ~il[characters], such as parentheses and escape ~il[characters], are not
  afforded their usual reverence by our hack.  Furthermore, the
  question arises: in which package do we ~ilc[intern] the symbol?  The
  answer is, usually, the package containing the name being defined.
  I.e., if you are documenting ~c[my-pkg::name] and you attach a
  ~il[documentation] string that begins ~c[\":Doc-Section: Machines ...\"] then
  the section-symbol will be ~c[my-pkg::machines].  We recognize two
  special cases. If the first character read is a colon, we use the
  ~c[keyword] package.  If the first five ~il[characters] read are ~c[acl2::] then
  we ~il[intern] in the ~c[\"ACL2\"] package.  Our own section names, e.g.,
  ~ilc[events], are in the ~c[\"ACL2\"] package.

  In a related area, when you ask for the ~il[documentation] of a name,
  e.g., when you type ~c[:doc name] at the terminal, that name is read
  with the full ACL2 reader, not the hack just described.  That name
  is read into the current package.  Thus, if you are operating
  ~ilc[in-package] ~c[\"MY-PKG\"] and type ~c[:doc events], what is read is
  ~c[my-pkg::events].  The database may not contain an entry for this
  symbol.  Before reporting that no ~il[documentation] exists, we try
  ~c[acl2::events].

  One last note: ~ilc[defpkg] permits a formatted ~il[documentation] string,
  which is associated in the database with the name of the package.
  But the name of the package is a string, not a symbol.  It is
  permitted to access the ~il[documentation] of a string (i.e., package
  name).  But there are no facilities for getting such a ~ilc[stringp] name
  into the related names of another name nor of making such ~il[stringp]
  names be section names.  That is because we always read symbols from
  strings and never read strings from strings.  I.e., if you did write
  ~c[\"Doc-Section \\\"MY-PKG\\\" ...\"] it would read in as a weird
  symbol.~/")

  For a general discussion of our treatment of documentation strings,
  ~pl[documentation].

  This is the first cut at online ~il[documentation].  Users can be
  particularly helpful by sending mail on the inadequacies of the
  system.  Address it just to Moore and put ~il[Documentation] in the
  subject line.  There are several things that trouble me about what
  I've done here.

  First, many concepts aren't documented.  Ultimately, I'd like to
.  document (a) every CLTL primitive (e.g., ~ilc[case] and ~ilc[coerce]) and (b)
  every ACL2 extension (e.g., ~ilc[aref1] and ~c[getprop]).  But so far I have
  focussed on documenting (c) the ACL2 system primitives (e.g., ~ilc[defthm]
  and what ~ilc[hints] look like).  My priorities are (c), then (b), and
  then (a), following the philosophy that the most unstable features
  should get online ~il[documentation] in these early releases.  Having
  gotten the basic ~il[documentation] in place, I'll document new things as
  they are added, and in response to your pleas I'll try to add
  ~il[documentation] to old things that are widely regarded as important.

  Second, I worry that the existing ~il[documentation] is unhelpful because
  it provides too much or too little detail, or it provides the detail
  too far away from where it is needed.  Please be on the lookout for
  this.  Did you get what you needed when you appealed to ~c[:doc] or
  ~c[:]~ilc[more-doc]?  If not, what was it you needed?  Would more
  cross-references ~il[help]?  Did you get lost in maze of
  cross-references?"

  NOTE:  The ~c[:docs] command only makes sense at the terminal.

  When the ~c[:docs] command is given a ~ilc[stringp] argument it searches the
  text produced by ~c[:]~ilc[doc] and ~c[:]~ilc[more-doc] and lists all the
  documented topics whose text contains the given string.  For purposes of this
  string matching we ignore distinctions of case and the amount and kind (but
  not presence) of white space.  We also treat hyphen as whitespace.

  However, the following examples show how ~c[:docs] can be used on other than
  string patterns.

  ~bv[]
  Examples:
  ACL2 !>:docs *           ; lists documentation sections
  ACL2 !>:docs **          ; lists all documented topics within all sections
  ACL2 !>:docs events      ; lists all topics in section EVENTS
  ACL2 !>:docs \"compil\"    ; lists topics ``apropos''
  ~ev[]~/

  The database of formatted ~il[documentation] strings is structured into
  sections.  Within a section are topics.  Each topic has a one-liner,
  some notes, and some detailed discussions.  The ~c[:docs] command
  provides a view of the entire database.

  ~c[:docs] takes one argument, as described below:
  ~bv[]
  arg               effect

  *                 list all section headings in the database
  **                list all section headings and all topics within
                    each section
  name              list all topics in the section named name (where
                    name is some symbol other than * and **).  This
                    is always the same as :doc name.
  pattern           list all topics whose :doc or :more-doc text
                    mentions the string pattern.  For purposes of this

  a name created by a logical event~/

  Examples:
  assoc
  caddr
  +
  \"ACL2-USER\"
  \"arith\"
  \"project/task-1/arith.lisp\"
  :here
  ~ev[]~/

  A logical name is either a name introduced by some event, such as
  ~ilc[defun], ~ilc[defthm], or ~ilc[include-book], or else is the keyword ~c[:here], which
  refers to the most recent such event.  ~l[events].  Every
  logical name is either a symbol or a string.  For the syntactic
  rules on names, ~pl[name].  The symbols name functions, macros,
  constants, axioms, theorems, labels, and ~il[theories].  The strings name
  packages or ~il[books].  We permit the keyword symbol ~c[:here] to be used as
  a logical name denoting the most recently completed event.

  The logical name introduced by an ~il[include-book] is the full book name
  string for the book (~pl[full-book-name]).  Thus, under the
  appropriate setting for the current book directory (~pl[cbd])
  the event ~c[(include-book \"arith\")] may introduce the logical name
  ~bv[]
  \"/usr/home/smith/project/task-1/arith.lisp\" .
  ~ev[]
  Under a different ~ilc[cbd] setting, it may introduce a different
  logical name, perhaps
  ~bv[]
  \"/local/src/acl2/library/arith.lisp\" .
  ~ev[]
  It is possible that identical ~ilc[include-book] events forms in a
  session introduce two different logical names because of the current
  book directory.

  A logical name that is a string is either a package name or a book
  name.  If it is not a package name, we support various conventions
  to interpret it as a book name.  If it does not end with the string
  ~c[\".lisp\"] we extend it appropriately.  Then, we search for any book
  name that has the given logical name as a terminal substring.
  Suppose ~c[(include-book \"arith\")] is the only ~il[include-book] so far and
  that ~c[\"/usr/home/smith/project/task-1/arith.lisp\"] is the source
  file it processed.  Then ~c[\"arith\"], ~c[\"arith.lisp\"] and
  ~c[\"task-1/arith.lisp\"] are all logical names identifying that
  ~ilc[include-book] event (unless they are package names).  Now suppose a
  second ~c[(include-book \"arith\")] is executed and processes
  ~c[\"/local/src/acl2/library/arith.lisp\"].  Then ~c[\"arith\"] is no longer
  a logical name, because it is ambiguous.  However, ~c[\"task-1/arith\"]
  is a logical name for the first ~ilc[include-book] and ~c[\"library/arith\"]
  is a logical name for the second.  Indeed, the first can be named by
  ~c[\"1/arith\"] and the second by ~c[\"y/arith\"].

  Logical names are used primarily in the theory manipulation
  functions, e.g., ~ilc[universal-theory] and ~ilc[current-theory] with which you
  may obtain some standard ~il[theories] as of some point in the historical
  past.  The reference points are the introductions of logical names,
  i.e., the past is determined by the ~il[events] it contains.  One might
  ask, ``Why not discuss the past with the much more flexible language
  of ~il[command] descriptors?'' (~l[command-descriptor].)  The reason
  is that inside of such ~il[events] as ~ilc[encapsulate] or macro ~il[command]s that
  expand to ~ilc[progn]s of ~il[events], ~il[command] descriptors provide too coarse a
  grain.

  When logical names are used as referents in theory expressions used
  in ~il[books], one must consider the possibility that the defining event
  within the book in question becomes redundant by the definition of
  the name prior to the assumption of the book.

  The recorded ~il[history] of your interactions with the top-level ACL2
  ~il[command] loop is marked by the ~il[command]s you typed that changed the
  logical ~il[world].  Each such ~il[command] generated one or more ~il[events],
  since the only way for you to change the logical ~il[world] is to execute
  an event function.  ~l[command] and ~pl[events].  We divide
  ~il[history] into ``~il[command] blocks,'' grouping together each ~il[world]
  changing ~il[command] and its ~il[events].  A ``~il[command] descriptor'' is an
  object that can be used to describe a particular ~il[command] in the
  ~il[history] of the ongoing session.

  Each ~il[command] is assigned a unique integer called its ``~il[command]
  number'' which indicates the ~il[command]'s position in the chronological
  ordering of all of the ~il[command]s ever executed in this session
  (including those executed to initialize the system).  We assign the
  number 1 to the first ~il[command] you type to ACL2.  We assign 2 to the
  second and so on.  The non-positive integers are assigned to
  ``prehistoric'' ~il[command]s, i.e., the ~il[command]s used to initialize the
  ACL2 system: 0 is the last ~il[command] of the initialization, -1 is the
  one before that, etc.

  The legal ~il[command] descriptors are described below.  We use ~c[n] to
  denote any integer, ~c[sym] to denote any logical name
  (~pl[logical-name]), and ~c[cd] to denote, recursively, any ~il[command]
  descriptor.

  :min   -- the earliest command (i.e., the one with the smallest

            descriptors.  We search the interval from cd1 through cd2
            for the first command that matches pat.  Note that if cd1
            occurs chronologically after cd2, the search is
            ``backwards'' through history while if cd1 occurs
            chronologically before cd2, the search is ``forwards''.  A
            backwards search will find the most recent match; a

  ~c[Enter-boot-strap-mode] is a Common Lisp function but not an ACL2
  function.  It magically creates from ~c[nil] an ACL2 property list ~il[world]

  ~c[enter-boot-strap-mode] has created its ~il[world], it is possible to
  process the ~ilc[defconst]s, ~ilc[defun]s, and ~ilc[defaxiom]s, necessary to bring up
  the rest of the system.  Before that ~il[world] is created, the attempt
  by ACL2 even to translate a ~ilc[defun] form, say, would produce an error
  because ~ilc[defun] is undefined.

  Several ACL2 functions show ~c[enter-boot-strap-mode] as their defining
  ~il[command].  Among them are ~ilc[if], ~ilc[cons], ~ilc[car], and ~ilc[cdr].  These functions

  ":Doc-Section Other

  explore an ACL2 cons tree~/

  By typing ~c[(walkabout x state)] for an ACL2 term ~c[x] whose value is a
  ~ilc[cons] tree, you can walk around that tree.  For example, ACL2 developers
  often use this utility to explore the ACL2 logical ~il[world].~/

  When you issue a ~c[walkabout] command, a summary of commands will be printed
  before you enter an interactive loop.
  ~bv[]
  Commands:
  0, 1, 2, ..., nx, bk, pp, (pp n), (pp lev len), =, (= symb), and q.
  ~ev[]
  In the interactive ~c[walkabout] loop, a positive integer n takes you to the
  nth position, while 0 takes you up a level.  The commands ~c[nx] and ~c[bk]
  take you to the next and previous position, respectively, at the same level.
  The command ~c[pp] prints the current object in full, while
  ~c[(pp level length)] hides sub-objects below the indicated level and past
  the indicated length, if non-~c[nil]; ~pl[evisc-tuple].  The command
  ~c[(pp n)] abbreviates ~c[(pp n n)], so in particular ~c[(pp nil)] is
  equivalent to ~c[pp].

  The following example illustrates the commands described above.
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>(walkabout (append '(a (b1 b2 b3)) '(c d e f)) state)

  Commands:
  0, 1, 2, ..., nx, bk, pp, (pp n), (pp lev len), =, (= symb), and q.

  (A (B1 B2 B3) C ...)

  :(pp 1 4)
  (A # C D ...)
  :(pp nil 2)
  (A (B1 B2 ...) ...)
  :q
  ACL2 !>
  ~ev[]

  Finally we describe the commands ~c[q], ~c[=], and ~c[(= symb)], where
  ~c[symb] is a symbol.  The command ~c[q] simply causes an exit from the
  ~c[walkabout] loop.  The command ~c[=] also exits, but causes the current
  object to be printed in full.  The command ~c[(= symb)] saves an association
  of ~c[symb] with the current object, which can be retrieved outside the
  ~c[walkabout] loop using the macro ~c[walkabout=], as illustrated below.
  ~bv[]
  :2
  (B1 B2 B3)
  :(= my-list)
  (walkabout= MY-LIST) is
  (B1 B2 B3)
  :q
  ACL2 !>(walkabout= MY-LIST)
  (B1 B2 B3)
  ACL2 !>
  ~ev[]

  Finally, we remark that for trees that are not true-lists, ~c[walkabout]
  treats the dot as an object that can be ``walked about''.  The following
  example illustrates this point.
  ~bv[]

  ":Doc-Section Bdd

  inspect failed BDD proof attempts~/

  Attempts to use BDDs (~pl[bdd]), using ~c[:]~ilc[bdd] ~il[hints],
  can fail for various reasons.  Sometimes it is useful to explore
  such failures.  To do so, one may simply execute the form
  ~bv[]
  (show-bdd)
  ~ev[]
  inside the ACL2 loop.  The system's response is generally
  self-explanatory.  Perhaps you have already seen ~c[show-bdd] used in
  some examples (~pl[bdd-introduction] and ~pl[if*]).  Here we
  give some details about ~c[show-bdd].~/

  ~c[(Show-bdd)] prints the goal to which the BDD procedure was applied
  and reports the number of nodes created during the ~il[BDD]
  computation, followed by additional information depending on whether
  or not the computation ran to completion or aborted (for reasons
  explained elsewhere; ~pl[bdd-algorithm]).  If the computation
  did abort, a backtrace is printed that should be useful in
  understanding where the problem lies.  Otherwise, ~c[(show-bdd)]
  prints out ``falsifying constraints.''  This list of pairs
  associates ~il[term]s with values and suggests how to construct a
  binding list for the variables in the conjecture that will falsify
  the conjecture.  It also prints out the ~il[term] that is the result
  of simplifying the input ~il[term].  In each of these cases, parts
  of the object may be hidden during printing, in order to avoid
  creating reams of uninteresting output.  If so, the user will be
  queried about whether he wishes to see the entire object (alist or
  ~il[term]), which may be quite large.  The following responses are
  legal:
  ~bq[]
  ~c[  w] ~-[] Walk around the object with a structure editor

  ~c[  t] ~-[] Print the object in full

  ~c[nil] ~-[] Do not print any more of the object
  ~eq[]

  ~c[Show-bdd] actually has four optional arguments, probably rarely
  used.  The general form is
  ~bv[]
  (show-bdd goal-name goal-ans falsifying-ans term-ans)
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[goal-name] is the name of the goal on which the ~c[:]~ilc[bdd]
  hint was used (or, ~c[nil] if the system should find such a goal),
  ~c[goal-ans] is the answer to be used in place of the query for
  whether to print the input goal in full, ~c[falsifying-ans] is the
  answer to be used in place of the query for whether to print the
  falsifying constraints in full, and ~c[term-ans] is the answer to be
  used in place of the query for whether to print the resulting
  ~il[term] in full."

; setting is used for EACH term in terms, whereas the latter allows a
; different setting for each term in terms.

; Call this function with stobjs-out t if you want

; stobjs-out '(nil state nil), for example, if you want to ensure that

; We now turn to the major question of translating user typed hints into
; their internal form.  We combine this translation process with the
; checking that ensures that the hints are legal.  While our immediate
; interest is in the hints for defuns, we in fact handle all the hints
; supported by the system.

; Defthm takes a keyword argument, :HINTS, whose expected value is a
; "hints" of the form ((str1 . hints1) ... (strn . hintsn)) where
; each stri is a string that parses to a clause-id and each hintsi is
; a keyword/value list of the form :key1 val1 ... :keyk valk, where a
; typical :keyi might be :USE, :DO-NOT-INDUCT, :IN-THEORY, etc.  Thus,
; a typical defthm event might be:

; (defthm foo (equal x x)
;   :hints (("Goal''" :use assoc-of-append :in-theory *bar*)))

; Defun, the other event most commonly given hints, does not have room
; in its arg list for :HINTS since defun is a CLTL primitive.  So we have
; implemented the notion of the XARGS of DEFUN and permit it to have as its
; value a keyword/value list exactly like a keyword/value list in macro
; calls.  Thus, to pass the hint above into a defun event you would write

; (defun foo (x)
;   (declare (xargs :hints (("Goal''" :use assoc-of-append :in-theory *bar*))))
;   body)

; Making matters somewhat more complicated are the facts that defuns may
; take more than one defun tuple, i.e., one might be defining a clique of
; functions

;  (defuns
;    (fn1 (x) (DECLARE ...) ... body1)
;    ...
;    (fnn (x) (DECLARE ...) ... bodyn))

; and each such tuple may have zero or more DECLARE forms (or, in
; general, arbitrary forms which macroexpand into DECLARE forms).
; Each of those DECLAREs may have zero or more XARGS and we somehow
; have to extract a single list of hints from them collectively.  What
; we do is just concatenate the hints from each DECLARE form.  Thus,
; it is possible that fn1 will say to use hint settings hs1 on
; "Goal''" and fn2 will say to use hs2 on it.  Because we concatenate
; in the presented order, the clause-id's specified by fn1 have the
; first shot.

; The basic function we define below is translate-hints which takes a
; list of the alleged form ((str1 . hint-settings1) ...) and
; translates the strings and processes the keyword/value pairs
; appropriately.

; Just for the record, the complete list of hint keywords that might
; be used in a given hint-settings may be found in *hint-keywords*.

; For each hint keyword, :x, we have a function,
; translate-x-hint-value, that checks the form.  Each of these
; functions gets as its arg argument the object that was supplied as
; the value of the keyword.  We cause an error or return a translated
; value.  Of course, "translate" here means more than just apply the
; function translate; it means "convert to internal form", e.g.,
; in-theory hints are evaluated into theories.

  restrictions on certain functions introduced in ~ilc[encapsulate] ~il[events]~/

  Suppose that a given theorem, ~c[thm], is to be functionally instantiated
  using a given functional substitution, ~c[alist].  (~l[lemma-instance], or
  for an example, ~pl[functional-instantiation-example].)  What is the set of
  proof obligations generated?  It is the set obtained by applying ~c[alist] to
  all terms, ~c[tm], such that (a) ~c[tm] mentions some function symbol in the
  domain of ~c[alist], and (b) either (i) ~c[tm] arises from the ``constraint''
  on a function symbol ancestral in ~c[thm] or in some ~ilc[defaxiom] or (ii)
  ~c[tm] is the body of a ~ilc[defaxiom].  Here, a function symbol is
  ``ancestral'' in ~c[thm] if either it occurs in ~c[thm], or it occurs in the
  definition of some function symbol that occurs in ~c[thm], and so on.

  The remainder of this note explains what we mean by ``constraint'' in the
  words above.~/

  In a certain sense, function symbols are introduced in essentially two ways.
  The most common way is to use ~ilc[defun] (or when there is mutual recursion,
  ~ilc[mutual-recursion] or ~ilc[defuns]).  There is also a mechanism for
  introducing ``witness functions''; ~pl[defchoose].  The documentation for
  these ~il[events] describes the axioms they introduce, which we will call
  here their ``definitional axioms.''  These definitional axioms are generally
  the constraints on the function symbols that these axioms introduce.

  However, when a function symbol is introduced in the scope of an
  ~ilc[encapsulate] event, its constraints may differ from the definitional
  axioms introduced for it.  For example, suppose that a function's definition
  is ~ilc[local] to the ~ilc[encapsulate]; that is, suppose the function is
  introduced in the ~il[signature] of the ~ilc[encapsulate].  Then its
  constraints include, at the least, those non-~ilc[local] theorems and
  definitions in the ~ilc[encapsulate] that mention the function symbol.

  Actually, it will follow from the discussion below that if the
  ~il[signature] is empty for an ~ilc[encapsulate], then the constraint on
  each of its new function symbols is exactly the definitional axiom
  introduced for it.  Intuitively, we view such ~c[encapsulates] just
  as we view ~ilc[include-book] ~il[events].  But the general case, where the
  ~il[signature] is not empty, is more complicated.

  In the discussion that follows we describe in detail exactly which
  constraints are associated with which function symbols that are introduced in
  the scope of an ~ilc[encapsulate] event.  In order to simplify the exposition
  we make two cuts at it.  In the first cut we present an over-simplified
  explanation that nevertheless captures the main ideas.  In the second cut we
  complete our explanation by explaining how we view certain ~il[events] as
  being ``lifted'' out of the ~ilc[encapsulate], resulting in a possibly
  smaller ~ilc[encapsulate], which becomes the target of the algorithm
  described in the first cut.

  At the end of this note we present an example showing why a more naive
  approach is unsound.

  Finally, before we start our ``first cut,'' we note that any information you
  want ``exported'' outside an ~ilc[encapsulate] event must be there as an
  explicit definition or theorem.  For example, even if a function ~c[foo] has
  output type ~c[(mv t t)] in its ~il[signature], the system will not know
  ~c[(true-listp (foo x))] merely on account of this information.  Thus, if you
  are using functions like ~c[foo] (constrained ~ilc[mv] functions), then you
  may find it useful to prove (inside the ~c[encapsulate], to be exported) a
  ~c[:]~ilc[type-prescription] rule for the constrained function, for example,
  the ~c[:]~ilc[type-prescription] rule ~c[(true-listp (foo x))].

  ~em[First cut at constraint-assigning algorithm.]  Quite simply, the formulas
  introduced in the scope of an ~ilc[encapsulate] are conjoined, and each
  function symbol introduced by the ~ilc[encapsulate] is assigned that
  conjunction as its constraint.

  Clearly this is a rather severe algorithm.  Let us consider two possible
  optimizations in an informal manner before presenting our second cut.

  Consider the (rather artificial) event below.  The function ~c[before1] does
  not refer at all, even indirectly, to the locally-introduced function
  ~c[sig-fn], so it is unfortunate to saddle it with constraints about
  ~c[sig-fn].
  ~bv[]
  (encapsulate
   (((sig-fn *) => *))

   (defun before1 (x)
     (if (consp x)
         (before1 (cdr x))
       x))

   (local (defun sig-fn (x) (cons x x)))

   (defthm sig-fn-prop
     (consp (sig-fn x)))
   )
  ~ev[]
  We would like to imagine moving the definition of ~c[before1] to just in
  front of this ~ilc[encapsulate], as follows.
  ~bv[]
  (defun before1 (x)
    (if (consp x)
        (before1 (cdr x))
      x))

  (encapsulate
   (((sig-fn *) => *))

   (local (defun sig-fn (x) (cons x x)))

   (defthm sig-fn-prop
     (consp (sig-fn x)))
   )
  ~ev[]
  Thus, we will only assign the constraint ~c[(consp (sig-fn x))], from the
  theorem ~c[sig-fn-prop], to the function ~c[sig-fn], not to the function
  ~c[before1].

  More generally, suppose an event in an ~ilc[encapsulate] event does not
  mention any function symbol in the ~il[signature] of the ~ilc[encapsulate],
  nor any function symbol that mentions any such function symbol, and so on.
  (We might say that no function symbol from the ~il[signature] is an
  ``ancestor'' of any function symbol occurring in the event.)  Then we imagine
  moving the event, so that it appears in front of the ~ilc[encapsulate].  We
  don't actually move it, but we pretend we do when it comes time to assign
  constraints.  Thus, such definitions only introduce definitional axioms as
  the constraints on the function symbols being defined.  In the example above,
  the event ~c[sig-fn-prop] introduces no constraints on function ~c[before1].

  Once this first optimization is performed, we have in mind a set of
  ``constrained functions.''  These are the functions introduced in the
  ~ilc[encapsulate] that would remain after moving some of them in front, as
  indicated above.  Consider the collection of all formulas introduced by the
  ~ilc[encapsulate], except the definitional axioms, that mention these
  constrained functions.  So for example, in the event below, no such formula
  mentions the function symbol ~c[after1].
  ~bv[]
  (encapsulate
   (((sig-fn *) => *))

   (local (defun sig-fn (x) (cons x x)))

   (defthm sig-fn-prop
     (consp (sig-fn x)))

   (defun after1 (x)
     (sig-fn x))
   )
  ~ev[]
  We can see that there is really no harm in imagining that we move the
  definition of ~c[after1] out of the ~ilc[encapsulate], to just after the
  ~ilc[encapsulate].

  Many subtle aspects of this rearrangement process have been omitted.  For
  example, suppose the function ~c[fn] uses ~c[sig-fn], the latter being a
  function in the signature of the encapsulation.  Suppose a formula about
  ~c[fn] is proved in the encapsulation.  Then from the discussion above ~c[fn]
  is among the constrained functions of the encapsulate: it cannot be moved
  before the encapsulate and it cannot be moved after the encapsulation.  But
  why is ~c[fn] constrained?  The reason is that the theorem proved about
  ~c[fn] may impose or express constraints on ~c[sig-fn].  That is, the theorem
  proved about ~c[fn] may depend upon properties of the witness used for
  ~c[sig-fn].  Here is a simple example:
  ~bv[]
  (encapsulate
   (((sig-fn *) => *))

   (local (defun sig-fn (x) (declare (ignore x)) 0))

   (defun fn (lst)
     (if (endp lst)
         t
         (and (integerp (sig-fn (car lst)))
              (fn (cdr lst)))))

   (defthm fn-always-true
     (fn lst)))
  ~ev[]
  In this example, there are no ~ilc[defthm] events that mention ~c[sig-fn]
  explicitly.  One might therefore conclude that it is completely
  unconstrained.  But the witness we chose for it always returns an integer.
  The function ~c[fn] uses ~c[sig-fn] and we prove that ~c[fn] always returns
  true.  Of course, the proof of this theorem depends upon the properties of
  the witness for ~c[sig-fn], even though those properties were not explicitly
  ``called out'' in theorems proved about ~c[sig-fn].  It would be unsound to
  move ~c[fn-always-true] after the encapsulate.  It would also be unsound to
  constrain ~c[sig-fn] to satisfy just ~c[fn-always-true] without including in
  the constraint the relation between ~c[sig-fn] and ~c[fn].  Hence both
  ~c[sig-fn] and ~c[fn] are constrained by this encapsulation and the
  constraint imposed on each is the same and states the relation between the
  two as characterized by the equation defining ~c[fn] as well as the property
  that ~c[fn] always returns true.  Suppose, later, one proved a theorem about
  ~c[sig-fn] and wished to functionally instantiate it.  Then one must also
  functionally instantiate ~c[fn], even if it is not involved in the theorem,
  because it is only through ~c[fn] that ~c[sig-fn] inherits its constrained
  properties.

  This is a pathological example that illustrate a trap into which one may
  easily fall: rather than identify the key properties of the constrained
  function the user has foreshadowed its intended application and constrained
  those notions.  Clearly, the user wishing to introduce the ~c[sig-fn] above
  would be well-advised to use the following instead:
  ~bv[]
  (encapsulate
   (((sig-fn *) => *))
   (local (defun sig-fn (x) (declare (ignore x)) 0))
   (defthm integerp-sig-fn
     (integerp (sig-fn x))))

  (defun fn (lst)
    (if (endp lst)
        t
      (and (integerp (sig-fn (car lst)))
           (fn (cdr lst)))))

  (defthm fn-always-true
     (fn lst)))
  ~ev[]
  Note that ~c[sig-fn] is constrained merely to be an integer.  It is the only
  constrained function.  Now ~c[fn] is introduced after the encapsulation, as a
  simple function that uses ~c[sig-fn].  We prove that ~c[fn] always returns
  true, but this fact does not constrain ~c[sig-fn].  Future uses of ~c[sig-fn]
  do not have to consider ~c[fn] at all.

  Sometimes it is necessary to introduce a function such as ~c[fn] within the
  ~c[encapsulate] merely to state the key properties of the undefined function
  ~c[sig-fn].  But that is unusual and the user should understand that both
  functions are being constrained.

  Another subtle aspect of encapsulation that has been brushed over so far has
  to do with exactly how functions defined within the encapsulation use the
  signature functions.  For example, above we say ``Consider the collection of
  all formulas introduced by the encapsulate,
  ~em[except the definitional axioms], that mention these constrained
  functions.''  We seem to suggest that a definitional axiom which mentions a
  constrained function can be moved out of the encapsulation and considered
  part of the ``post-encapsulation'' extension of the logical ~il[world], if
  the defined function is not used in any non-definitional formula proved in
  the encapsulation.  For example, in the encapsulation above that constrained
  ~c[sig-fn] and introduced ~c[fn] within the encapsulation, ~c[fn] was
  constrained because we proved the formula ~c[fn-always-true] within the
  encapsulation.  Had we not proved ~c[fn-always-true] within the
  encapsulation, ~c[fn] could have been moved after the encapsulation.  But
  this suggests an unsound rule because whether such a function can be moved
  after the encapsulate depend on whether its ~em[admission] used properties of
  the witnesses!  In particular, we say a function is ``subversive'' if any of
  its governing tests or the actuals in any recursive call involve a function
  in which the signature functions are ancestral.  ~l[subversive-recursions].

  (Aside: The definition of ~c[fn] in the first enapsulation above that defines
  ~c[fn], i.e., the encapsulation with ~c[fn-always-true] inside, is subversive
  because the call of the macro ~ilc[AND] expands to a call of ~c[IF] that
  governs a recursive call of ~c[fn], in this case:
  ~bv[]
  (defun fn (lst)
    (if (endp lst)
        t
        (if (integerp (sig-fn (car lst)))
            (fn (cdr lst))
          nil))).
  ~ev[]
  If we switch the order of conjuncts in ~c[fn], then the definition of ~c[fn]
  is no longer subversive, but it still ``infects'' the constraint generated
  for the encapsulation, hence for ~c[sig-fn], because ~c[fn-always-true]
  blocks the definition of ~c[fn] from being moved back (to after the
  encapsulation).  If we both switch the order of conjuncts and drop
  ~c[fn-always-true] from the encapsulation, then the definition of ~c[fn] is
  in essence moved back to after the encapsulation, and the constraint for
  ~c[sig-fn] no longer includes the definition of ~c[fn].  End of aside.)

  Another aspect we have not discussed is what happens to nested encapsulations
  when each introduces constrained functions.  We say an ~c[encapsulate] event
  is ``trivial'' if it introduces no constrained functions, i.e., if its
  signatures is ~c[nil].  Trivial encapsulations are just a way to wrap up a
  collection of events into a single event.

  From the foregoing discussion we see we are interested in exactly how we can
  ``rearrange'' the events in a non-trivial encapsulation -- moving some
  ``before'' the encapsulation and others ``after'' the encapsulation.  We are
  also interested in which functions introduced by the encapsulation are
  ``constrained'' and what the ``constraints'' on each are.  We may summarize
  the observations above as follows, after which we conclude with a more
  elaborate example.

  ~em[Second cut at constraint-assigning algorithm.]  First, we focus only on
  non-trivial encapsulations that neither contain nor are contained in
  non-trivial encapsulations.  (Nested non-trivial encapsulations are not
  rearranged at all: do not put anything in such a nest unless you mean for it
  to become part of the constraints generated.)  Second, in what follows we
  only consider the non-~c[local] events of such an ~c[encapsulate], assuming
  that they satisfy the restriction of using no locally defined function
  symbols other than the signature functions.  Given such an ~c[encapsulate]
  event, move, to just in front of it and in the same order, all definitions
  and theorems for which none of the signature functions is ancestral.  Now
  collect up all formulas (theorems) introduced in the ~ilc[encapsulate] other
  than definitional axioms.  Add to this set any of those definitional
  equations that is either subversive or defines a function used in a formula
  in the set.  The conjunction of the resulting set of formulas is called the
  ``constraint'' and the set of all the signature functions of the
  ~c[encapsulate] together with all function symbols defined in the
  ~c[encapsulate] and mentioned in the constraint is called the ``constrained
  functions.''  Assign the constraint to each of the constrained functions.
  Move, to just after the ~c[encapsulate], the definitions of all function
  symbols defined in the ~c[encapsulate] that have been omitted from the
  constraint.

  Implementation note.  In the implementation we do not actually move
  ~il[events], but we create constraints that pretend that we did.

  Here is an example illustrating our constraint-assigning algorithm.  It
  builds on the preceding examples.
  ~bv[]
  (encapsulate
   (((sig-fn *) => *))

   (defun before1 (x)
     (if (consp x)
         (before1 (cdr x))
       x))

   (local (defun sig-fn (x) (cons x x)))

   (defthm sig-fn-prop
     (consp (sig-fn x)))

   (defun during (x)
     (if (consp x)
         x
       (cons (car (sig-fn x))
             17)))

   (defun before2 (x)
     (before1 x))

   (defthm before2-prop
     (atom (before2 x)))

   (defthm during-prop
     (implies (and (atom x)
                   (before2 x))
              (equal (car (during x))
                     (car (sig-fn x)))))

   (defun after1 (x)
     (sig-fn x))

   (defchoose after2 (x) (u)
     (and (< u x) (during x)))
   )
  ~ev[]

  Only the functions ~c[sig-fn] and ~c[during] receive extra constraints.  The
  functions ~c[before1] and ~c[before2] are viewed as moving in front of the
  ~ilc[encapsulate], as is the theorem ~c[before2-prop].  The functions
  ~c[after1] and ~c[after2] are viewed as being moved past the
  ~ilc[encapsulate].  The implementation reports the following.
  ~bv[]
  In addition to SIG-FN, we export AFTER2, AFTER1, BEFORE2, DURING and
  BEFORE1.

  The following constraint is associated with both of the functions DURING and
  SIG-FN:

  (AND (EQUAL (DURING X)
              (IF (CONSP X)
                  X (CONS (CAR (SIG-FN X)) 17)))
       (CONSP (SIG-FN X))
       (IMPLIES (AND (ATOM X) (BEFORE2 X))
                (EQUAL (CAR (DURING X))
                       (CAR (SIG-FN X)))))
  ~ev[]
  Notice that the formula ~c[(consp (during x))] is not a conjunct of the
  constraint.  During the first pass of the ~c[encapsulate], this formula is
  stored as a ~c[:]~ilc[type-prescription] rule deduced during the definition
  of the function ~c[during].  However, the rule is not exported because of a
  rather subtle soundness issue.  (If you are interested in details, see the
  comments in source function ~c[putprop-type-prescription-lst].)

  We conclude by asking (and to a certain extent, answering) the following
  question: Isn't there an approach to assigning constraints that avoids
  over-constraining more simply than our ``second cut'' above?  Perhaps it
  seems that given an ~ilc[encapsulate], we should simply assign to each
  locally defined function the theorems exported about that function.  If we
  adopted that simple approach the events below would be admissible.

  ~bv[]
  (encapsulate
   (((foo *) => *))
   (local (defun foo (x) x))
   (defun bar (x)
     (foo x))
   (defthm bar-prop
     (equal (bar x) x)
     :rule-classes nil))

  (defthm foo-id
    (equal (foo x) x)
    :hints ((\"Goal\" :use bar-prop)))

  ; The following event is not admissible in ACL2.

  (defthm ouch!
    nil
    :rule-classes nil
    :hints
    ((\"Goal\" :use
      ((:functional-instance foo-id
                             (foo (lambda (x) (cons x x))))))))
  ~ev[]
  Under the simple approach we have in mind, ~c[bar] is constrained to satisfy
  both its definition and ~c[bar-prop] because ~c[bar] mentions a function
  declared in the signature list of the encapsulation.  In fact, ~c[bar] is
  so-constrained in the ACL2 semantics of encapsulation and the first two
  events above (the ~c[encapsulate] and the consequence that ~c[foo] must be
  the identity function) are actually admissible.  But under the simple
  approach to assigning constraints, ~c[foo] is unconstrained because no
  theorem about it is exported.  Under that approach, ~c[ouch!] is provable
  because ~c[foo] can be instantiated in ~c[foo-id] to a function other than
  the identity function.

  It's tempting to think we can fix this by including definitions, not just
  theorems, in constraints.  But consider the following slightly more elaborate
  example.  The problem is that we need to include as a constraint on ~c[foo]

; Substn is alleged to be a functional substitution.  We know that it is a true
; list!  We check that each element is a pair of the form (fn1 fn2), where fn1
; is an instantiable function symbol of arity n and fn2 is either a function
; symbol of arity n or else a lambda expression of arity n with a body that
; translates.  We also check that no fn1 is bound twice.

; Note: We permit free variables to occur in the body, we permit implicitly
; ignored variables, and we do not permit declarations in the lambda.  That is,
; we take each lambda to be of the form (lambda (v1 ... vn) body) and we merely
; insist that body be a term with no particular relation to the vi.

; If substn satisfies these conditions we return an alist in which each pair
; has the form (fn1 . fn2'), where fn2' is the symbol fn2 or the lambda
; expression (lambda (v1 ... vn) body'), where body' is the translation of
; body.  We call this the translated functional substitution.  The returned
; result is sorted by car; see event-responsible-for-proved-constraint for how
; we make use of this fact.

; Warning: The presence of free variables in the lambda expressions means that
; capturing is possible during functional substitution.  We do not check that
; no capturing occurs, since we are not given the terms into which we will

; After Version_3.4, Ruben Gamboa added the variable allow-freevars-p, with the
; following explanation:

; Allow-freevars-p should be set to t in the #-:non-standard-analysis case, but
; otherwise set to nil when we are trying to apply the substitution to a
; non-classical formula.  In those cases, free variables in the body can
; capture non-standard objects, resulting in invalid theorems.  For example,
; take the following theorem
;
; (standardp x) => (standardp (f x))
;
; This theorem is true for classical constrained function f.  Now instantiate
; (f x) with (lambda (x) (+ x y)).  The result is
;
; (standardp x) => (standardp (+ x y))
;
; This formula is false.  E.g., it fails when x=0 and y=(i-large-integer).

(defun sublis-fn-rec (alist term bound-vars allow-freevars-p)

; See the comment just above for additional discussion of allow-freevars-p.

; This function carries out the functional substitution into term specified by
; the translated functional substitution alist.  It checks that alist does not
; allow capturing of its free variables by lambda expressions in term.  If
; allow-freevars-p is nil, it also checks that the alist does not have free
; variables in lambda expressions.  The return value is either (mv vars term),
; for vars a non-empty list of variables -- those having captured occurrences
; when allow-freevars-p is true, else all free variables of lambda expressions
; in alist when allow-freevars-p is nil -- or else is (mv nil new-term) when
; there are no such captures or invalid free variables, in which case new-term
; is the result of the functional substitution.  Note that the caller can tell
; whether an error is caused by capturing or by having disallowed free
; variables, since in the case that allow-freevars-p is nil, it is impossible
; for free variables to be captured (since no free variables are allowed).

; Let us say that an occurrence of fn in term is problematic if fn is bound to
; lambda-expr in alist and for every variable v that occurs free in
; lambda-expr, this occurrence of fn is not in the scope of a lambda binding of
; v.  Key Observation: If there is no problematic occurrence of any function
; symbol in term, then we can obtain the result of this call of sublis-fn by
; first replacing v in lambda-app by a fresh variable v', then carrying out the
; functional substitution, and finally doing an ordinary substitution of v for
; v'.  This Key Observation explains why it suffices to check that there is no
; such problematic occurrence.  As we recur, we maintain bound-vars to be a
; list that includes all variables lambda-bound in the original term at the
; present occurrence of term.

; Every element of alist is either of the form (fn . sym) or of the form (fn
; . (LAMBDA (v1...vn) body)) where the vi are distinct variables and body is a
; translated term, but it is not known that body mentions only vars in formals.

; The former case, where fn is bound to a sym, is simple to handle: when we see
; calls of fn we replace them by calls of sym.  The latter case is not.  When
; we hit (g (FOO) y) with the functional substitution in which FOO gets (LAMBDA
; NIL X), we generate (g X y).  Note that this "imports" a free X into a term,
; (g (foo) y), where there was no X.

; But there is a problem.  If you hit ((lambda (z) (g (FOO) z)) y) with FOO
; gets (LAMBDA NIL X), you would naively produce ((lambda (z) (g X z)) y),
; importing the X into the G term as noted above.  But we also just imported
; the X into the scope of a lambda!  Even though there is no capture, we now
; have a lambda expression whose body contains a var not among the formals.
; That is not a term!

; The solution is to scan the new lambda body, which is known to be a term, and
; collect the free vars -- vars not bound among the formals of the lambda --
; and add them both to the lambda formals and to the actuals.

; name (in the sense of constraint-info).

; Exception: We are free to return (mv *unknown-constraints* g cl-proc).

  additional requirements for ~c[:functional-instance] hints in ACL2(r)~/

  This documentation topic relates to ACL2(r), the modification of ACL2 that
  supports the real numbers (~pl[real]).

  ~l[hints] and ~pl[lemma-instance] for a discussion of ~c[:use] hints that
  employ the ~c[:functional-instance] keyword.  Here, we document additional
  requirements for such hints that applies to ACL2(r).  We assume familiarity
  with lemma instances; ~pl[lemma-instance].

  (1) When functionally instantiating a non-classical formula, it is illegal
  to use pseudo-lambda expressions in a lemma instance.

  (2) A classical function symbol must be bound either to a classical function
  symbol or to a lambda (or, if allowed, pseudo-lambda) expression with a
  classical body.  Similarly, a non-classical function symbol must be bound
  either to a non-classical function symbol or to a lambda (or, if allowed,
  pseudo-lambda) expression with a non-classical body.~/~/")

(deflabel lemma-instance
  :doc
  ":Doc-Section Miscellaneous

  an object denoting an instance of a theorem~/

  Lemma instances are the objects one provides via ~c[:use] and ~c[:by] ~il[hints]
  (~pl[hints]) to bring to the theorem prover's attention some previously
  proved or easily provable fact.  A typical use of the ~c[:use] hint is given
  below.  The value specified is a list of five lemma instances.
  ~bv[]
  :use (reverse-reverse
        (:type-prescription app)
        (:instance assoc-of-app
                   (x a) (y b) (z c))
        (:functional-instance p-f
                              (p consp) (f flatten))
        (:instance (:theorem (equal x x))
                   (x (flatten a))))
  ~ev[]
  Observe that an event name can be a lemma instance.  The ~c[:use] hint allows
  a single lemma instance to be provided in lieu of a list, as in:
  ~bv[]
  :use reverse-reverse
  ~ev[]
  or
  ~bv[]
  :use (:instance assoc-of-app (x a) (y b) (z c))
  ~ev[]~/

  A lemma instance denotes a formula which is either known to be a theorem or
  which must be proved to be a theorem before it can be used.  To use a lemma
  instance in a particular subgoal, the theorem prover adds the formula as a
  hypothesis to the subgoal before the normal theorem proving heuristics are
  applied.

  A lemma instance, or ~c[lmi], is of one of the following five forms:

  (1) ~c[name], where ~c[name] names a previously proved theorem, axiom, or
  definition and denotes the formula (theorem) of that name.

  (2) ~c[rune], where ~c[rune] is a ~il[rune] (~pl[rune]) denoting the
  ~c[:]~ilc[corollary] justifying the rule named by the ~il[rune].

  (3) ~c[(:theorem term)], where ~c[term] is any term alleged to be a theorem.
  Such a lemma instance denotes the formula ~c[term].  But before using such a
  lemma instance the system will undertake to prove ~c[term].

  (4) ~c[(:instance lmi (v1 t1) ... (vn tn))], where ~c[lmi] is recursively a
  lemma instance, the ~c[vi]'s are distinct variables and the ~c[ti]'s are
  terms.  Such a lemma instance denotes the formula obtained by instantiating
  the formula denoted by ~c[lmi], replacing each ~c[vi] by ~c[ti].  Normally
  ACL2 enforces the requirement that every variable ~c[vi] must be bound in the
  formula denoted by ~c[lmi].  However, the keyword ~c[:extra-bindings-ok] may
  be inserted immediately after the lemma instance in order to remove that
  requirement: ~c[(:instance lmi :extra-bindings-ok (v1 t1) ... (vn tn))].

  (5) ~c[(:functional-instance lmi (f1 g1) ... (fn gn))], where ~c[lmi] is
  recursively a lemma instance and each ~c[fi] is an ``instantiable'' function
  symbol of arity ~c[ni] and ~c[gi] is a function symbol, a macro alias for a
  function symbol ~c[gi'] (~pl[macro-aliases-table]) in which case we treat
  ~c[gi] as ~c[gi'], or a pseudo-lambda expression of arity ~c[ni].  An
  instantiable function symbol is any defined or constrained function symbol
  except the primitives ~ilc[not], ~ilc[member], ~ilc[implies], and ~ilc[o<],
  and a few others, as listed by the constant
  ~c[*non-instantiable-primitives*].  These are built-in in such a way that we
  cannot recover the ~il[constraint]s on them.  (Special case: a function
  introduced in the ~c[:partial-theory] of a dependent clause-processor is not
  instantiable; ~pl[define-trusted-clause-processor].)  A pseudo-lambda
  expression is an expression of the form ~c[(lambda (v1 ... vn) body)] where
  the ~c[vi] are distinct variable symbols and ~c[body] is any term.  No
  ~i[a priori] relation is imposed between the ~c[vi] and the variables of
  ~c[body], i.e., ~c[body] may ignore some ~c[vi]'s and may contain ``free''
  variables.  However, we do not permit ~c[v] to occur freely in ~c[body] if
  the functional substitution is to be applied to any formula (~c[lmi] or the
  ~il[constraint]s to be satisfied) in a way that inserts ~c[v] into the scope
  of a binding of ~c[v] by ~ilc[let] or ~ilc[mv-let] (or, ~ilc[lambda]).  If
  you happen to violate this restriction, an informative error message will be
  printed.  That message will list for you the potentially illegal choices for
  ~c[v] in the context in which the functional substitution is offered.  A
  ~c[:functional-instance] lemma instance denotes the formula obtained by
  functionally instantiating the formula denoted by ~c[lmi], replacing ~c[fi]
  by ~c[gi].  However, before such a lemma instance can be used, the system
  will generate proof obligations arising from the replacement of the ~c[fi]'s
  by the ~c[gi]'s in constraints that ``support'' the lemma to be functionally
  instantiated; ~pl[constraint].  One might expect that if the same
  instantiated constraint were generated on behalf of several events, then each
  of those instances would have to be proved.  However, for the sake of
  efficiency, ACL2 stores the fact that such an instantiated constraint has
  been proved and avoids it in future events.

  Note that ACL2(r) (~pl[real]) imposes additional requirements for functional
  instantiation.  ~l[functional-instantiation-in-acl2r].

  Obscure case for ~il[definition]s.  If the lemma instance refers to a
  ~c[:definition] ~il[rune], then it refers to the ~ilc[corollary] formula of
  that rune, which can be a simplified (``normalized'') form of the original
  formula.  However, if the hint is a ~c[:by] hint and the lemma instance is
  based on a name (i.e., a symbol), rather than a rune, then the formula is the
  original formula of the event, as shown by ~c[:]~ilc[pe], rather than the
  normalized version, as shown by ~c[:]~ilc[pf].  This is as one would expect:
  If you supply the name of an event, you expect it to refer to the original
  event.  For ~c[:use] hints we use the simplified (normalized) form instead,
  which is reasonable since one would expect simplification during the proof
  that re-traces the normalization done at the time the rule was created.

; A Brief History of a Rapidly Changing Notation (Feb 28, 1990)

; Once upon a time, lemma instance had the form (assoc-of-append :x
; a).  We adopted the policy that if a substitution was going to be
; applied to a lemma, term, and x was in the domain of the
; substitution, then one wrote :x and wrote the substitution "flat",
; without parentheses around the variable/term pairs.  In general, :x
; meant "the variable symbol in term whose symbol name was "x"."  We
; enforced the restrictin that there was at most one variable symbol
; in a stored formula with a given symbol name.

; At that time we denoted lemma instances with such notation as
; (assoc-of-append :x a :y b :z c).  Functional instances were not yet
; implemented.  But in order to disambiguate the use of a single
; lemma instance from the use of several atomic instances, e.g.,
;    :use (assoc-of-append :x a :y b :z c)
; versus
;    :use (assoc-of-append rev-rev)
; we relied on the idea that the domain elements of the substitution
; were keywords.

; The implementation of functional instantiation changed all that.
; First, we learned that the translation of a keyword domain element,
; e.g., :fn, into a function symbol could not be done in a way
; analogous to what we were doing with variables.  Which function is
; meant by :fn?  You might say, "the one with that symbol name in the
; target theorem being instantiated."  But there may be no such symbol
; in the target theorem; the user may want to instantiate :fn in some
; constraint being proved for that theorem's instantiation.  But then
; you might say "then search the constraint too for a suitable meaning
; for :fn."  Ah ha!  You can't compute the constraint until you know
; which functions are being instantiated.  So the general idea of
; using the target to translate keyword references just fails and it
; was necessary to come up with an unambiguous way of writing a
; substitution.  We temporarily adopted the idea that the "keywords"
; in flat substitutions might not be keywords at all.  E.g., you could
; write ACL2-NQTHM::X as a domain element.  That might have put into
; jeapardy their use to disambiguate :use hint.

; But simultaneously we adopted the idea that lemma instances are
; written as (:instance assoc-of-append ...) or (:functional-instance
; assoc-of-append ...).  This was done so lemma instances could be
; nested, to allow functional instances to then be instantiated.  But
; with the keyword at the beginning of a lemma instance it suddenly
; became possible to disambiguate :use hints:
;   :use (assoc-of-append rev-rev)
; can mean nothing but use two lemma instances because the argument to
; the use is not a lemma instance.

; So we were left with no compelling need to have keywords and flat
; substitutions and a lot of confusion if we did have keywords.  So we
; abandoned them in favor of the let-bindings like notation.

  In general, ACL2 warns when ~ilc[in-theory] ~il[events] or ~il[hints] leave
  you in a theory where a rule for a built-in function is disabled but may be
  applied in some cases nonetheless, because of special-purpose prover code for
  handling calls of that function.  The built-in function symbols with such
  ~il[definition] rules or ~il[executable-counterpart] rules are those in the
  following two lists, respectively.

(defun@par translate-custom-keyword-hint (arg uterm2 ctx wrld state)

; We run the checker term for the associated custom keyword and handle
; any error it generates.  But if no error is generated, the
; translation of arg (the user-supplied value for the custom keyword)
; is arg itself.

; Why do we not allow non-trivial translation of custom keyword hint
; values?  The main reason is that custom keyword hints do not see the
; translated values of common standard hints so why should they expect
; to see the translated values of custom hints?  While the author of
; custom keyword :key1 might like its argument to be translated, he
; probably doesn't want to know about the translated form of other
; custom keyword values.  Finally, when custom keyword hints generate
; new hints, they cannot be expected to translate their values.  And
; if they didn't translate their values then after one round of custom
; hint evaluation we could have a mix of translated and untranslated
; hint values: standard hints would not be translated -- no user wants
; to know the internal form of lmi's or theories! -- and some custom
; hint values would be translated and others wouldn't.  Furthermore,
; it is impossible to figure out which are which.  The only solution
; is to keep everything in untranslated form.  Example:
; Let :key1, :key2, and :key3 be custom keywords and suppose the user
; wrote the hint

;    :key1 val1  :key2 val2 :in-theory (enable foo)

; If we allowed non-trivial translation of custom hints, then at
; translate-time we'd convert that to

;    :key1 val1' :key2 val2' :in-theory (enable foo)

; Note the mix.  Then at prove-time we'd run :key1's generator on
; val1' and the whole hint.  It might return

;                :key2 val2' :key3 val3 :in-theory (enable foo)

; Note the additional mix.  We can't tell what's untranslated and what
; isn't, unless we made custom hint authors translate all custom
; hints, even those they don't "own."

; carefully when eagerp = t.  It is possible in that case that the
; returned value, val, of (mv t erp state), is actually the symbol

; HIST, PSPV, CTX, and STATE, except that if if hint-type is non-nil then there

; where term' is the translation of term and flg indicates whether
; STABLE-UNDER-SIMPLIFICATIONP occurs freely in it.

; the form (key . val), such as (:DO-NOT-INDUCT . T) or (:USE . (lmi-lst
; (h1...hn) ...)).  Lists of such pairs are called "hint settings."  A pair
; consisting of a clause-id and some hint-settings is called a "(translated)
; hint".  A list of such pairs is called "(translated) hints."

; Thus, following the :HINTS keyword to defthm, the user types "hints" (in
; untranslated form).  This function takes a lst, which is supposed be some
; hints, and translates it or else causes an error.

; Essay on the Handling of Override-hints

; When we translate an explicit (not computed) hint in the presence of at least
; one non-trivial override hint in the world, we append to the front of the
; hint-settings the list (:keyword-alist . x) (:name-tree . n), where x is the
; untranslated keyword-alist corresponding to hint-settings and n is the
; name-tree used for translation: so the hint is (goal-name (:keyword-alist
; . x) (:name-tree . n) (kwd1 . v1) ... (kwdk . vk)).  Later, when we select
; the hint with find-applicable-hint-settings, we will see (:keyword-alist . x)
; and apply the override-hints to x, and if the result of apply-override-hints
; is also x, then we will return ((kwd1 . v1) ... (kwdk . vk)); otherwise we
; will translate that result.  Note that in the special case that the original
; hint had at least one custom keyword hint but the ultimate resulting
; expansion was an explicit hint, the same technique will apply.  Also note
; that the keyword :keyword-alist is illegal for users, and would be flagged as
; such by translate-hint in translate-hints1; so we have full control over the
; use of :keyword-alist (and similarly for :name-tree).

; If however the resulting translated hint is a computed hint, i.e. a list
; whose car is 'eval-and-translate-hint-expression, then no modification is
; necessary; function find-applicable-hint-settings takes care to apply
; override-hints, by calling function eval-and-translate-hint-expression with
; the override-hints supplied.

; And how about backtrack hints?  Backtrack hints are computed hints, and
; receive the same treatment as described above, i.e. for computed hints
; selected by find-applicable-hint-settings -- namely, by passing the world's
; override-hints to eval-and-translate-hint-expression.

  a list of hints given priority in every proof attempt~/

  This is an advanced feature, originally implemented to help system designers
  to create ``modes'' that control the way hints are supplied to the theorem
  prover.  Please ~pl[default-hints] for the much more usual way to install
  hints that may be applied by default.~/

  ~bv[]
  Examples:
  ACL2 !>(override-hints (w state))
  ((computed-hint-1 clause keyword-alist processor)
   (computed-hint-2 clause keyword-alist stable-under-simplificationp))
  ~ev[]
  ~c[Override-hints] returns a list of computed hints (~pl[computed-hints])
  which, unlike other computed hints, may mention the variable
  ~c[KEYWORD-ALIST].

  Before reading further, please ~pl[hints-and-the-waterfall] to review the
  basics of how ~il[hints] are applied during a proof.  In particular, we
  assume familiarity with the notion of selecting a hint to be applied to the
  current goal.  If there are override-hints, that hint selection is tentative,
  because if it reduced to ~c[nil] after the application of override-hints,
  then that hint will be skipped and the attempt will continue for selecting an
  applicable hint.  (Craft your override-hints so that ~c[:no-op t] is returned
  in such cases instead of ~c[nil], if you don't want the hint to be skipped.)
  But we must explain what is meant by ``the application of override-hints'',
  and we do that now.

  Suppose that there are override-hints when a hint is selected for the current
  goal.  That selected hint is a keyword-alist, which is an alternating list of
  hint keywords and their values, whose source is either an explicit hint
  ~c[(goal-name :key1 val1 ... :keyn valn)] where the ~c[:keyi] are allowed to
  be custom hint keywords (which are expanded away; ~pl[custom-keyword-hints]),
  or else is the non-~c[nil] keyword-alist produced by evaluating a computed
  hint.  Then the override-hints are applied to that keyword-alist as follows,
  one at a time, in order of their occurrence in the list of override-hints (as
  determined by the use of ~ilc[set-override-hints] and
  ~ilc[add-override-hints]).  The first override-hint is evaluated, in the
  usual manner of evaluating computed hints but with the variable
  ~c[KEYWORD-ALIST] bound to the above keyword-alist.  That evaluation produces
  a result that should also be a keyword-alist, or else an error occurs.  Any
  custom keyword hints are then eliminated from that keyword-alist.  The
  resulting keyword-alist must not contain the ~c[:ERROR] hint keyword and must
  not start with the ~c[:COMPUTED-HINT-REPLACEMENT] keyword; otherwise an error
  occurs.  With ~c[KEYWORD-ALIST] bound to this result, the second
  override-hint is similarly evaluated.  This process continues, and the
  keyword-alist returned by the final override-hint is the one used when
  processing the goal at hand.  Except: If that keyword-alist is ~c[nil], then
  the next hint among the pending hints is tentatively selected and the process
  repeats, applying each override hint to that new tentative selection.  Of
  course we might obtain ~c[nil] again, in which case we tentatively select the
  next pending hint; and so on.

  If finally no hint is selected for the current goal, then ~c[KEYWORD-ALIST]
  is bound to ~c[nil] and the override-hints are applied as described above.
  But note that this final step is skipped if hint selection is being performed
  because ~c[stable-under-simplificationp] has just become true, rather than at
  the top of the waterfall.  (Otherwise the override-hints could easily keep
  firing uselessly yet putting us back at the top of the waterfall, with no
  change to the given goal, resulting in an infinite loop.)

  As mentioned above, the ~c[:COMPUTED-HINT-REPLACEMENT] keyword is illegal for
  the value of an override-hint.  But a selected hint may be a computed hint
  that evaluates to a keyword-alist beginning with prefix
  ~c[:COMPUTED-HINT-REPLACEMENT val].  What value does ACL2 return for such a
  computed hint in the presence of override-hints?  First, this prefix is
  stripped off before passing the resulting keyword-alist to the override-hints
  as described above.  If the result of applying override-hints to that
  keyword-alist is not ~c[nil], then the prefix is put back on the front of
  that resulting keyword-alist after doing internal processing of the hint,
  including expansion of any custom keyword hints.  Otherwise, the application
  of override-hints to the computed hint is ~c[nil], so this hint is not
  selected after all.

  ~st[WARNING]: Unlike ordinary computed hints, a value of ~c[nil] for an
  override-hint is not ignored.  That is: When an ordinary computed hint
  evaluates to ~c[nil], it is deemed not to apply, and the next available hint
  is consulted.  But when an override-hint is evaluated, the result is always
  supplied for the next binding of the variable ~c[KEYWORD-ALIST], even if that
  result is ~c[nil].  If you want an override-hint to be a no-op, return as the
  expression the variable ~c[KEYWORD-ALIST] rather than an expression that
  evaluates to ~c[nil].

  This feature can be used in order to implement a form of additive hints.
  Suppose for example that you want a hint that turns off generalization.  A
  simple but inadequate solution is:
  ~bv[]
  (add-default-hints '((quote (:do-not '(generalize)))))
  ~ev[]
  The problem is that if there is any explicit hint supplied for a given goal,
  then it will be the one selected, and the above will be ignored.  But suppose
  that the explicit hint supplied is of the form
  ~c[(\"Subgoal x.y\" :do-not '(fertilize))].  What we would really want in
  this case is to generate the hint for the indicated subgoal that binds
  ~c[:do-not] to a list indicating that both fertilization _and_ generalization
  are disabled for that goal.  A solution is to merge, for example as follows.
  (The use of ~ilc[prog2$] and ~ilc[cw] is of course optional, included here to
  provide debug printing.)

; Tuple is of the form (name-tree flg term), where term is a translated
; single-threaded error-triple producing term that mentions, at most, the
; variables ID, CLAUSE, CLAUSE-LIST, PROCESSOR, KEYWORD-ALIST, WORLD,
; STABLE-UNDER-SIMPLIFICATIONP, HIST, PSPV, CTX, and STATE; and flg is a flag
; indicating whether the variable STABLE-UNDER-SIMPLIFICATIONP occurs freely in
; term.  We eval term under the corresponding alist, obtaining a value val, and
; if val is non-erroneous and non-nil then we treat it as though it were a
; keyword-alist from an untranslated hint, i.e., (:key1 val1 ...), and
; translate it, using name-tree as the gensym name-tree for :bye hints.  We
; return the translated hint-settings or nil.

; The above description is inaccurate in three respects.  First, after the
; evaluation of term we restore proof related components of state.  Our
; intention is that the user have state so the computed hint can, say,
; translate terms and print error messages.  But we cannot prevent the user
; from abusing state and doing things like reading from files (which we can't
; undo) or changing the logical world with defun or defthm (which we can undo).
; So think of us as ignoring the state returned by the evaluation and reverting
; to the original one.

; Second, let's first remind ourselves that a computed hint gets to specify not
; just what the hint-settings is for this application but also gets to affect
; the hints that will be available later.  A computed hint can direct the
; system to (a) remove itself from the hints after the application, (b) leave
; itself in after the application, or (c) replace itself with a list of other
; hints.  This direction is provided by including the keyword
; :COMPUTED-HINT-REPLACEMENT and an associated value in the result, val, of the
; evaluation.

; The :COMPUTED-HINT-REPLACEMENT keyword and its value, chr, if provided, MUST
; BE THE FIRST two elements of val.

; The first paragraph is correct when val does not start with
; :COMPUTED-HINT-REPLACEMENT.  Otherwise, val is of the form
; (:COMPUTED-HINT-REPLACEMENT chr . keyword-alist) and this is what we do.  If
; keyword-alist is nil then we return (value nil).  Otherwise, we treat
; keyword-alist as an untranslated hint-settings and translate it.  We inspect
; chr to see whether it is (a) nil, (b) t, or (c) something else.  The first
; two mean the hint is to be (a) deleted or (b) preserved.  The last is

  to indicate where a hint is to be used~/
  ~bv[]
  Examples:
  \"Goal\"
  \"goal\"
  \"Subgoal *1/3''\"
  \"subgoal *1/3''\"
  \"[2]Subgoal *1/3''\"
  ~ev[]~/

  When ~il[hints] are given to the theorem prover, a goal-spec is provided
  to specify the goal to which the ~il[hints] are to be applied.  The ~il[hints]
  provided are carried along innocuously until the named goal arises.
  When it arises, the ~il[hints] are ``activated'' for that goal and its
  descendents.

  A legal goal specification may be extracted from the theorem
  prover's output.  Certain lines clearly label formulas, as in
  ~bv[]
  Subgoal *1/3.2'
  (IMPLIES ... ...)
  ~ev[]
  and these lines all give rise to goal specifications.  In general,
  these lines all start either with ``Goal'' or ``Subgoal'' or else
  with those words preceded by a number in square brackets, as in
  ~bv[]
  [1]Subgoal *1/3.2'
  (IMPLIES ... ...).
  ~ev[]
  A goal specification may be obtained by deleting any surrounding
  whitespace from such a line and embedding the text in string
  quotation marks.  Thus
  ~bv[]
  \"[1]Subgoal *1/3.2'\"
  ~ev[]
  is the goal specifier for the goal above.

  As noted, a hint is applied to a goal when the hint's goal
  specification matches the name ACL2 assigns to the goal.  The
  matching algorithm is case-insensitive.  Thus, alternative goal
  specifications for the goal above are ~c[\"[1~]subgoal *1/3.2'\"] and
  ~c[\"[1~]SUBGOAL *1/3.2'\"].  The matching algorithm does not tolerate
  non-case discrepancies.  Thus, ~c[\"[1~]Subgoal*1/3.2'\"] and
  ~c[\" [1~]Subgoal *1/3.2'\"] are unacceptable.

  Sometimes a formula is given two names, e.g.,
  ~bv[]
  Subgoal *1/14.2'
  (IMPLIES ...
           ...)
  Name the formula above *1.1.
  ~ev[]
  It is the first name (the one that starts with ``Goal'' or
  ``Subgoal'') and not the second which constitutes a legal goal-spec.
  Roughly speaking, when the system prints the line containing the
  goal specification, it activates any ~il[hints] that are attached to that
  goal-spec.  Consider the example above.  Suppose ~c[Subgoal *1/14.2']
  could be proved by using a certain lemma instance.  Then the
  appropriate entry in the ~il[hints] would be:
  ~bv[]
  (\"Subgoal *1/14.2'\" :use ...)
  ~ev[]
  This might surprise you because the system appears to do nothing
  to ~c[*1/14.2'] besides push it for a subsequent induction.  But
  actually between the time the system printed the goal-spec line and
  the time it decides to push the goal, you can think of the system as
  trying everything it has.  So a ~c[use] hint activated when
  ~c[Subgoal *1/14.2'] arises is just what you want.

  But what if you want to give an ~c[:induct] hint?  By the time induction
  is tried, the formula has been given the name ~c[*1.1].  Well, this is
  one you just have to remember:
  ~bv[]
  (\"Subgoal *1/14.2'\" :induct ...).
  ~ev[]
  When the above hint is activated the ~c[:induct] directive
  short-circuits the rest of the processing and sends immediately the
  formula into the pool of goals to prove by induction.  The induct
  hint is attached to the formula in the pool and when the time comes
  to turn our attention to that goal, the induct advice is
  followed.

  We conclude by emphasizing a point made above, that a hint is applied to a
  goal when the hint's goal specification matches the name ACL2 assigns to the
  goal.  If there is no such match, then the hint is ignored.  Consider the
  following example.
  ~bv[]
  (thm (equal (append (append x y) z) (append x y z))
       :hints ((\"Subgoal *1/\" :in-theory nil)))
  ~ev[]
  Normally, ~c[:in-theory] hints are inherited by subgoals
  (~pl[hints-and-the-waterfall]), so you might expect that the empty theory is
  used in ~c[Subgoal *1/2] and ~c[Subgoal *1/1].  But in fact, since there is
  no subgoal printed that is labeled ~c[Subgoal *1/], the above ~c[:in-theory]
  hint is ignored.  The above example is in contrast to the following, where
  the hint makes the proof fail, because there really is a ~c[Subgoal *1/] in
  the proof this time.
  ~bv[]
  (thm (implies (and (not (endp x)) (not (endp (cdr x))))
                (equal (append (append x y) z) (append x y z)))

  how ~il[hints] fit into the ACL2 proof waterfall~/

  Below we describe the flow of an ACL2 proof attempt, with special attention
  to how ~il[hints] are applied during a proof.  For most ACL2 users, only one
  point is important to take away from this ~il[documentation] topic: you may
  specify hints during a proof (~pl[hints]; perhaps also ~pl[computed-hints]
  and ~pl[default-hints]), and they can be expected to behave intuitively.
  ~l[the-method] for a summary of how to interact with the ACL2 prover;
  ~pl[introduction-to-the-theorem-prover] for a more detailed tutorial; and
  ~pl[hints] for an introduction to ACL2 hints, including detailed
  ~il[documentation] for specific hint types.

  The remainder of this topic serves as a reference in case one needs a deeper
  understanding of the workings of ACL2's handling of hints.  Also, for
  examples of the sophisticated use of hints, primarily for experts, see
  community book ~c[books/hints/basic-tests.lisp].

  First, we describe the ACL2 ``waterfall'', which handles each goal either by
  replacing it with a list (possibly empty) of child goals, or else by putting
  the goal into a ``pool'' for later proof by induction.  Then, we describe how
  hints are handled by the waterfall.

  ~st[The Waterfall.]

  Each goal considered by the ACL2 prover passes through a series of proof
  processes, called the ``waterfall processes'', as stored in the constant
  ~c[*preprocess-clause-ledge*].  The top process applies top-level hints,
  including ~c[:use] hints; the next is a lightweight ``preprocess'' simplifier
  for ``simple'' rules (~pl[simple]); the next is the main ACL2 simplifier; and
  finally ACL2 attempts (in this order) destructor elimination, fertilization
  (heuristic use of equalities), generalization, and elimination of
  irrelevance.  Each process may ``hit'', creating zero or more child goals
  that are each then handled at the top of the waterfall; or it may ``miss'',
  in which case the next process in the above sequence is considered.  If all
  processes miss, then a ``push'' process defers the goal until it is later
  considered for proof by induction.  When all goals have been thus handled,
  the goal most recently pushed for proof by induction is considered, and the
  process repeats.

  We next describe the two additional ways in which control can be returned to
  the top of the waterfall.

  When the simplification process is attempted unsuccessfully for a goal, the
  goal is deemed to have ``settled down''.  In this case, and if no ancestor of
  the goal has settled down, then the ``settled-down'' process is deemed to
  have ``hit'' on the goal, the effect being that the goal makes a new pass
  through all the waterfall processes.  (Other processes can then notice that
  settling down has occurred and modify their heuristics accordingly.)  For
  example, if ~c[\"Goal\"] simplifies to ~c[\"Subgoal 2\"] (among others), and
  ~c[\"Subgoal 2\"] simplifies to ~c[\"Subgoal 2.3\"] (among others), which in
  turn is not further simplified, then the ``settled-down'' process hits on
  ~c[\"Subgoal 2.3\"] but not on any of its children, their children, and so
  on.

  When simplification has missed (and thus the goal has settled down), the next
  proof process is normally destructor elimination.  However, if a computed
  hint is suitable (in a sense described below; also ~pl[computed-hints],
  especially the discussion of ~c[stable-under-simplificationp]), then that
  hint is selected as control is returned to the top of the waterfall.  A
  subtlety is that in this case, if the most recent hit had been from settling
  down, then the prover ``changes its mind'' and considers that the goal has
  not yet settled down after all as it continues through the waterfall.

  Each time a goal is considered at the top of the waterfall, then before
  passing through the proof processes as described above, ACL2 searches for a
  relevant hint to select unless it has already been provided a hint in the
  ``~c[stable-under-simplificationp]'' case mentioned above.  We turn now to a
  more thorough discussion of how hints are selected and applied.~/

  ~st[The handling of hints.]

  In the discussion below we will ignore forcing rounds, as each forcing round
  is simply treated as a new proof attempt that uses the list of hints provided
  at the start of the proof.

  When the theorem prover is called by ~ilc[thm] or ~il[events] such as
  ~ilc[defthm], ~ilc[defun], and ~ilc[verify-guards], it gathers up the hints
  that have been supplied, often provided as a ~c[:]~ilc[hints] argument, but
  for example using a ~c[:guard-hints] argument for ~il[guard] verification
  proofs.  (ACL2(r) users (~pl[real]) may also employ ~c[:std-hints].)  It then
  appends these to the front of the list of default hints (~pl[default-hints]).
  The resulting list becomes the initial value of the list of ``pending
  hints'', one of two critical lists maintained by the theorem prover to manage
  hints.  The other critical list is a list of ``hint settings''; the two lists
  are maintained as follows.

  When a goal is first considered, a hint is selected from the list of pending
  hints if any is found to apply, as described below.  If a hint is selected,
  then it takes effect and is removed from the pending hints.  Except: if the
  selected hint is a computed hint with value ~c[t] specified for
  ~c[:computed-hint-replacement], then it is not removed; and if that value is
  a list of hints, then that list is appended to the front of the list of
  pending hints after the selected hint is removed (also ~pl[computed-hints]).
  The selected hint is also used to update the hint settings, as described
  below.

  The list of hint settings associates hint keywords with values.  It is passed
  from the current goal to its children (and hence the children's children, and
  so on), though modified by hints selected from pending hints, as described
  below.  This list is maintained so that when a goal is pushed for proof by
  induction, the hint settings are applied at the start of the proof by
  induction.  Note that the list of hint settings is not re-applied to
  descendents of a goal in the current waterfall; a hint is applied only when
  it is selected (and also perhaps later as just described, through the stored
  hint settings at the start of a proof by induction).  For example, if the
  hint selected for ~c[\"Subgoal 3\"] includes ~c[:in-theory (enable foo)],
  then the hint settings are correspondingly updated when processing
  ~c[\"Subgoal 3\"], and they persist at subgoals such as ~c[\"Subgoal 3.2\"]
  and ~c[\"Subgoal 3.2.1\"] (unless overriden by hints on those goals); but the
  theory specifying ~c[foo] is not re-installed at every such subgoal.

  When a hint is selected, the list of hint settings is updated so that for
  each keyword ~c[:kwd] and associated value ~c[val] from the hint, ~c[:kwd] is
  associated with ~c[val] in the hint settings, discarding any previous
  association of ~c[:kwd] with a value in the hint settings.  Except, certain
  ``top-level'' hints are never saved in the hint settings: ~c[:use],
  ~c[:cases], ~c[:by], ~c[:bdd], ~c[:or], and ~c[:clause-processor].

  For example, suppose that we specify the following hints, with no default
  hints.
  ~bv[]
  ((\"Goal\" :expand ((bar x y)))
   (\"Subgoal 3\" :in-theory (enable foo)))
  ~ev[]
  These hints then become the initial list of pending hints.  When the proof
  attempt begins, the prover encounters the top-level goal (~c[\"Goal\"]) and
  pulls the ~c[\"Goal\"] hint from the pending hints, so that the list of hint
  settings contains a value only for keyword ~c[:expand].  This hint setting
  will remain for all children of the top-level goal as well, and their
  children, and so on, and will be inherited by induction ~-[] in other words,
  it will remain throughout the entire proof.  Now consider what happens when
  the proof reaches ~c[\"Subgoal 3\"].  At this point there is only one pending
  hint, which is in fact attached to that subgoal.  Therefore, this hint is
  pulled from the pending hints (leaving that list empty), and the hint
  settings are extended by associating the ~c[:in-theory] keyword with the
  theory represented by ~c[(enable foo)].  That theory is immediately installed
  until the prover finishes addressing ~c[\"Subgoal 3\"], its children, their
  children, and so on; and until that completion is reached, the ~c[:in-theory]
  keyword remains associated with the ~c[(enable foo)] in the hint settings,
  although of course there is no re-installation of the theory at any ensuing
  child goal.  When finally ~c[\"Subgoal 3\"] and its descendents have been
  completed and the prover is about to consider ~c[\"Subgoal 2\"], the
  ~c[:in-theory] association is removed from the hint settings and the global
  theory is re-installed.  However, the list of pending hints remains empty.

  It remains to describe how a hint is selected for a goal.  When a goal is
  first considered (hence at the top of the waterfall), the list of pending
  hints is scanned, in order, until one of the hints is suitable for the goal.
  An explicit hint ~c[(goal-name :kwd1 val1 ... :kwdn valn)] is suitable if
  ~c[goal-name] is the name of the current goal and there is at least one
  keyword.  A computed hint is suitable if it evaluates to a non-~c[nil] value.
  As indicated earlier in this documentation topic, an exception occurs when a
  computed hint is selected after simplification fails (the
  ``~c[stable-under-simplificationp]'' case): in that case, the goal returns to
  the top of the waterfall with that hint as the selected hint, and no
  additional search for a hint to select is made at that time.

  The following slightly tricky example illustrates handling of hints.
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>(set-default-hints '((\"Goal\" :do-not '(preprocess))))
   ((\"Goal\" :DO-NOT '(PREPROCESS)))
  ACL2 !>(thm (equal (append (append x y) z) (append x y z))
              :hints ((\"Goal\" :in-theory (disable car-cons))))

  ACL2 Warning [Hints] in ( THM ...):  The goal-spec \"Goal\" is explicitly
  associated with more than one hint.  All but the first of these hints
  may be ignored.  If you intended to give all of these hints, combine
  them into a single hint of the form (\"Goal\" :kwd1 val1 :kwd2 val2 ...).
  See :DOC hints-and-the-waterfall.

  ~ev[]

  The warning above is printed because ~c[\"Goal\"] is associated with two
  pending hints: one given by the ~ilc[set-default-hints] call and one supplied
  by the ~c[:]~ilc[hints] keyword of the ~ilc[thm] form.  The ~c[:in-theory]
  hint is selected because user-supplied hints are ahead of default hints in
  the list of pending hints; we then get the first ``Note'' above.  The goal
  progresses through the waterfall without any proof process applying to the
  goal; in particular, it cannot be further simplified.  After the
  simplification process, a ``settled-down'' process applies, as discussed
  above, immediately causing another trip through the waterfall.  Since the
  ~c[:in-theory] hint was earlier removed from the list of pending hints when
  it was applied, the default (~c[:do-not]) hint is now the only pending hint.
  That hint is applied, resulting in the second ``Note'' above.

  Again, more examples may be found in the community book
  ~c[books/hints/basic-tests.lisp].  A particularly tricky but informative
  example in that book is the one related to ~c[nonlinearp-default-hint].

  which allows a single lemma name as a special case:
  ~bv[]
  :hints ((\"[1]Subgoal *1/1.2'\" :use lemma23))
  ~ev[]

  ACL2 also provides ``custom keyword'' hints (~pl[custom-keyword-hints])
  and even more general ``computed hints'' for the advanced user
  (~pl[computed-hints]).

  Only the first hint applicable to a goal, as specified in the user-supplied
  list of ~c[:hints] followed by the default hints (~pl[default-hints-table]),
  will be applied to that goal.  For an advanced exception,
  ~pl[override-hints].  For a detailed discussion of how hints fit into the
  ACL2 waterfall, ~pl[hints-and-the-waterfall].  For examples of the
  sophisticated use of hints, primarily for experts, see community book
  ~c[books/hints/basic-tests.lisp].~/

  Background: ~c[Hints] are allowed in all ~il[events] that use the theorem
  prover.  During ~ilc[defun] ~il[events] there are two different uses of the
  theorem prover: one to prove termination and another to verify the
  ~il[guard]s.  To pass a hint to the theorem prover during termination proofs,
  use the ~c[:hints] keyword in the ~ilc[defun]'s ~ilc[xargs] declaration.  To
  pass a hint to the theorem prover during the ~il[guard] verification portion
  of admitting a ~ilc[defun], use the ~c[:guard-hints] keyword in the
  ~ilc[defun]'s ~ilc[xargs] declaration.  The ~ilc[verify-guards] event and the
  ~ilc[defthm] event also use the theorem prover.  To pass hints to them, use
  the ~c[:hints] keyword argument to the event.

  where ~ilc[goal-spec] is as described elsewhere (~pl[goal-spec]) and the keys
  and their respective values are shown below with their interpretations.  (We
  also provide ``computed hints'' but discuss them separately;
  ~pl[computed-hints].)

  ~c[:DO-NOT-INDUCT]~nl[]
  ~c[Value] is ~c[t], ~c[:otf-flg-override], ~c[:otf], ~c[name] or ~c[nil],
  indicating whether ~il[induction] is permitted under the specified goal.  If
  ~c[value] is ~c[t] or ~c[:otf-flg-override], then the attempt to apply
  ~il[induction] to the indicated goal or any subgoal under the indicated goal
  will immediately cause the theorem prover to report ~il[failure], except that
  if ~c[:otf-flg t] is specified (~pl[otf-flg]) and ~c[value] is ~c[t], then
  the proof will continue until the time at which the goal pushed for induction
  is finally considered.  The latter behavior is also what occurs if ~c[value]
  is ~c[:otf].  Thus, any non-~c[nil] value requires the indicated goal to be
  proved entirely by simplification, destructor elimination, and the other
  ``waterfall'' processes.  ~il[Induction] to prove the indicated goal (or any
  subgoal) is not permitted.  See however the ~c[:induct] hint below.  If
  ~c[value] is a symbol other than ~c[t], ~c[:otf-flg-override], ~c[:otf] or
  ~c[nil], the theorem prover will give a ``bye'' to any subgoal that would
  otherwise be attacked with induction.  This will cause the theorem prover to
  fail eventually but will collect the necessary subgoals.  If ~c[value] is
  ~c[nil], this hint means ~il[induction] is permitted.  Since that is the
  default, there is no reason to use the value ~c[nil].  Note that a
  ~c[:do-not-induct] hint is ignored for any goal on which an ~c[:induct] hint
  is supplied.  For an advanced example of the use of value ~c[:otf] with
  ~il[override-hints], see community book ~c[books/hints/basic-tests.lisp].

  ~c[:DO-NOT]~nl[]
  ~c[Value] is a term having at most the single free variable ~ilc[world], which
  when evaluated (with ~ilc[world] bound to the current ACL2 logical ~il[world])
  produces a list of symbols that is a subset of the list
  ~bv[]
  (preprocess ;propositional logic, simple rules
   simplify   ;as above plus rewriting, linear arithmetic
   eliminate-destructors
   fertilize  ;use of equalities
   generalize
   eliminate-irrelevance).
  ~ev[]
  The hint indicates that the ``processes'' named should not be used
  at or below the goal in question.  Thus, to prevent generalization
  and fertilization, say, include the hint
  ~bv[]
  :do-not '(generalize fertilize)
  ~ev[]
  If ~c[value] is a single symbol, as in
  ~bv[]
  :do-not generalize,
  ~ev[]
  it is taken to be ~c['(value)].

  ~c[:EXPAND]~nl[]
  ~c[Value] is a true list of terms, each of which is of one of the forms
  ~c[(let ((v1 t1)...) b)] or ~c[(fn t1 ... tn)], where ~c[fn] is a defined
  function symbol with formals ~c[v1, ..., vn,] and ~c[body] ~c[b].  Such a
  term is said to be ``expandable:'' it can be replaced by the result of
  substituting the ~c[ti]'s for the ~c[vi]'s in ~c[b].  The terms listed in the
  ~c[:expand] hint are expanded when they are encountered by the simplifier
  while working on the specified goal or any of its subgoals.  We permit
  ~c[value] to be a single such term instead of a singleton list.
  ~st[Remarks]: (1) Allowed are ``terms'' of the form
  ~c[(:free (var1 var2 ...  varn) pattern)] where the indicated variables are
  distinct and ~c[pattern] is a term.  Such ``terms'' indicate that we consider
  the indicated variables to be instantiatable, in the following sense:
  whenever the simplifier encounters a term that can be obtained from
  ~c[pattern] by instantiating the variables ~c[(var1 var2 ...  varn)], then it
  expands that term.  (2) Also allowed are ``terms'' of the form
  ~c[(:with name term)], where ~c[name] is a function symbol, a macro name that
  denotes a function symbol (~pl[macro-aliases-table]), or a ~il[rune].  The
  corresponding rule of class ~c[:rewrite], which is often a ~il[definition]
  rule but need not be, is then used in place of the current body for the
  function symbol of ~c[term]; ~pl[show-bodies] and ~pl[set-body].  If the rule
  is of the form ~c[(implies hyp (equiv lhs rhs))], then after matching ~c[lhs]
  to the current term in a context that is maintaining equivalence relation
  ~c[equiv], ACL2 will replace the current term with
  ~c[(if hyp rhs (hide term))], or just ~c[rhs] if the rule is just
  ~c[(equal lhs rhs)].  (3) A combination of both ~c[:free] and ~c[:with], as
  described above, is legal.  (4) The term ~c[:LAMBDAS] is treated specially.
  It denotes the list of all lambda applications (i.e., ~ilc[let] expressions)
  encountered during the proof.  Conceptually, this use of ~c[:LAMBDAS] tells
  ACL2 to treat lambda applications as a notation for substitutions, rather
  than as function calls whose opening is subject to the ACL2 rewriter's
  heuristics (specifically, not allowing lambda applications to open when they
  introduce ``too many'' if terms).

  ~c[:HANDS-OFF]~nl[]
  ~c[Value] is a true list of function symbols or lambda expressions,
  indicating that under the specified goal applications of these
  functions are not to be rewritten.  Note however that subterms will still be
  rewritten; ~pl[hide] if that is not what is intended.  (The community book
  ~c[books/clause-processors/autohide.lisp] from Jared Davis may also be
  helpful in that case.) ~c[Value] may also be a single function symbol or
  lambda expression instead of a list.

  ~c[:]~ilc[IN-THEORY]~nl[]
  ~c[Value] is a ``theory expression,'' i.e., a term having at most the
  single free variable ~ilc[world] which when evaluated (with ~ilc[world] bound to
  the current ACL2 logical world (~pl[world])) will produce a
  theory to use as the current theory for the goal specified.
  ~l[theories].

  Note that an ~c[:]~ilc[IN-THEORY] hint will always be evaluated relative to
  the current ACL2 logical ~il[world], not relative to the theory of a previous
  goal.  Consider the following example.
  ~bv[]
  (defthm prop
    (p (f (g x)))
    :hints ((\"Goal\"      :in-theory (disable f))
            (\"Subgoal 3\" :in-theory (enable  g))))
  ~ev[]
  Consider in particular the theory in effect at ~c[Subgoal 3].  This
  call of the ~ilc[enable] macro enables ~c[g] relative to the
  ~ilc[current-theory] of the current logical ~il[world], ~em[not] relative to
  the theory produced by the hint at ~c[Goal].  Thus, the ~ilc[disable] of
  ~c[f] on behalf of the hint at ~c[Goal] will be lost at ~c[Subgoal 3], and
  ~c[f] will be enabled at ~c[Subgoal 3] if was enabled globally when ~c[prop]
  was submitted.

  ~c[:INDUCT]~nl[]
  ~c[Value] is either ~c[t] or a term containing at least one recursively
  defined function symbol; if ~c[t], this hint indicates that the system
  should proceed to apply its induction heuristic to the specified
  goal produced (without trying simplification, etc.); if ~c[value] is
  a term other than ~c[t], then not only should the system apply
  induction immediately, but it should analyze ~c[value] rather than
  the goal to generate its ~il[induction] scheme.  Merging and the
  other ~il[induction] heuristics are applied.  Thus, if ~c[value]
  contains several mergeable ~il[induction]s, the ``best'' will be
  created and chosen.  E.g., the ~c[:induct] hint
  ~bv[]
   (and (nth i a) (nth j a))
  ~ev[]
  suggests simultaneous ~il[induction] on ~c[i], ~c[j], and ~c[a].

  If both an ~c[:induct] and a ~c[:do-not-induct] hint are supplied for a
  given goal then the indicated ~il[induction] is applied to the goal and
  the ~c[:do-not-induct] hint is inherited by all subgoals generated.

  ~c[:USE]~nl[]
  ~c[Value] is a ~il[lemma-instance] or a true list of ~il[lemma-instance]s,
  indicating that the propositions denoted by the instances be added
  as hypotheses to the specified goal.  ~l[lemma-instance].  Note
  that ~c[:use] makes the given instances available as ordinary hypotheses
  of the formula to be proved.  The ~c[:instance] form of a ~il[lemma-instance]
  permits you to instantiate the free variables of previously proved
  theorems any way you wish; but it is up to you to provide the
  appropriate instantiations because once the instances are added as
  hypotheses their variables are no longer instantiable.  These new
  hypotheses participate fully in all subsequent rewriting, etc.  If
  the goal in question is in fact an instance of a previously proved
  theorem, you may wish to use ~c[:by] below.  Note that ~il[theories] may be
  helpful when employing ~c[:use] hints; ~pl[minimal-theory].

  Note that if the value is the name of a function symbol introduced by
  ~ilc[defun], then the ``normalized'' body of that definition is used, for
  which ACL2 has propagated ~c[IF] tests upward.  This behavior differs from
  that provided by a ~c[:by] hint, where the original body of the definition is
  used.

  ~c[:]~il[BDD]~nl[]
  This hint indicates that ordered binary decision diagrams (BDDs)
  with rewriting are to be used to prove or simplify the goal.
  ~l[bdd] for an introduction to the ACL2 BDD algorithm.

  ~c[Value] is a list of even length, such that every other element,
  starting with the first, is one of the keywords ~c[:vars],
  ~c[:bdd-constructors], ~c[:prove], or ~c[:literal].  Each keyword that
  is supplied should be followed by a value of the appropriate form,
  as shown below; for others, a default is used.  Although ~c[:vars]
  must always be supplied, we expect that most users will be content
  with the defaults used for the other values.

  ~c[:vars] ~-[] A list of ACL2 variables, which are to be treated as
  Boolean variables.  The prover must be able to check, using trivial
  reasoning (~pl[type-set]), that each of these variables is
  Boolean in the context of the current goal.  Note that the prover
  will use very simple heuristics to order any variables that do not
  occur in ~c[:vars] (so that they are ``greater than'' the variables
  that do occur in ~c[:vars]), and these heuristics are often far from
  optimal.  In addition, any variables not listed may fail to be
  assumed Boolean by the prover, which is likely to seriously impede
  the effectiveness of ACL2's BDD algorithm.  Thus, users are
  encouraged ~em[not] to rely on the default order, but to supply a
  list of variables instead.  Finally, it is allowed to use a value of
  ~c[t] for ~c[vars].  This means the same as a ~c[nil] value, except
  that the BDD algorithm is directed to fail unless it can guarantee
  that all variables in the input term are known to be Boolean (in a
  sense discussed elsewhere; ~pl[bdd-algorithm]).

  ~c[:literal] ~-[] An indication of which part of the current goal
  should receive BDD processing.  Possible values are:
  ~bv[]
    :all     treat entire goal as a single literal (the default)
    :conc    process the conclusion
    n        process the hypothesis with index n (1, 2, ...)
  ~ev[]

  ~c[:bdd-constructors] ~-[] When supplied, this value should be a
  list of function symbols in the current ACL2 ~il[world]; it is
  ~c[(cons)] by default, unless ~c[:bdd-constructors] has a value in
  the ~ilc[acl2-defaults-table] by default, in which case that value is
  the default.  We expect that most users will be content with the
  default.  ~l[bdd-algorithm] for information about how this
  value is used.

  ~c[:prove] ~-[] When supplied, this value should be ~c[t] or ~c[nil]; it
  is ~c[t] by default.  When the goal is not proved and this value is
  ~c[t], the entire proof will abort.  Use the value ~c[nil] if you are
  happy to the proof to go on with the simplified term.

  ~c[:CLAUSE-PROCESSOR]

  ~c[Value] specifies the application of a user-defined simplifier to the
  current goal.  ~l[clause-processor], which provides necessary background and
  hint syntax.  Also ~pl[define-trusted-clause-processor] for a discussion of
  ``trusted clause-processors'':  goal-level simplifiers that may be external
  to ACL2 and do not need to be proved correct in ACL2.

  You can see all current ~c[:clause-processor] rules by issuing the command
  ~c[(print-clause-processor-rules)], and you can see the names of all trusted
  clause-processors by issuing the command
  ~c[(table trusted-clause-processor-table)].

  ~c[:INSTRUCTIONS]

  ~c[Value] is a list of ~il[proof-checker] instructions; ~pl[instructions].
  Unlike other hint keywords described here, this one is actually a custom
  keyword hint (~pl[custom-keyword-hints]) that generates a suitable
  ~c[:]~ilc[clause-processor] hint.

  ~c[:CASES]~nl[]
  ~c[Value] is a non-empty list of terms.  For each term in the list, a
  new goal is created from the current goal by assuming that term; and
  also, in essence, one additional new goal is created by assuming all
  the terms in the list false.  We say ``in essence'' because if the
  disjunction of the terms supplied is a tautology, then that final
  goal will be a tautology and hence will in fact never actually be
  created.

  ~c[:BY]~nl[]
  ~c[Value] is a ~il[lemma-instance], ~c[nil], or a new event name. If the
  value is a ~il[lemma-instance] (~pl[lemma-instance]), then it indicates that
  the goal (when viewed as a clause) is either equal to the proposition denoted
  by the instance, or is subsumed by that proposition when both are viewed as
  clauses.  To view a formula as a clause, union together the negations of the
  hypotheses and add the conclusion.  For example,
  ~bv[]
  (IMPLIES (AND (h1 t1) (h2 t2)) (c t1))
  ~ev[]
  may be viewed as the clause
  ~bv[]
  {~~(h1 t1) ~~(h2 t2) (c t1)}.
  ~ev[]
  Clause ~c[c1] is ``subsumed'' by clause ~c[c2] iff some instance of ~c[c2] is a
  subset of ~c[c1].  For example, the clause above is subsumed by
  ~c[{~~(h1 x) (c x)}], which when viewed as a formula is
  ~c[(implies (h1 x) (c x))].

  Note that if the value is the name of a function symbol introduced by
  ~ilc[defun], then the original form of the body of that definition is used.
  This behavior differs from that provided by a ~c[:use] hint, where the
  so-called ``normalized'' body, for which ACL2 has propagated ~c[IF] tests
  upward.

  If the value is ~c[nil] or a new name, the prover does not even
  attempt to prove the goal to which this hint is attached.  Instead
  the goal is given a ``bye'', i.e., it is skipped and the proof
  attempt continues as though the goal had been proved.  If the prover
  terminates without error then it reports that the proof would have
  succeeded had the indicated goals been proved and it prints an
  appropriate ~il[defthm] form to define each of the ~c[:by] names.  The
  ``name'' ~c[nil] means ``make up a name.''  Here is an example (admittedly
  contrived for illustration purposes).
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>(thm (equal (append (append x y) z)
                     (append x y z))
              :hints ((\"Subgoal *1/2'\" :by nil)))

  Name the formula above *1.

  [[... output omitted here ...]]

  [Note:  A hint was supplied for our processing of the goal below.
  Thanks!]

  Subgoal *1/2'
  (IMPLIES (AND (CONSP X)
                (EQUAL (APPEND (APPEND (CDR X) Y) Z)
                       (APPEND (CDR X) Y Z)))
           (EQUAL (APPEND (APPEND X Y) Z)
                  (APPEND X Y Z))).

  But we have been asked to pretend that this goal is subsumed by the
  yet-to-be-proved |THM Subgoal *1/2'|.

  Subgoal *1/1
  [[... proof goes on; further output omitted here ...]]
  ~ev[]

  The system does not attempt to check the uniqueness of the ~c[:by] names
  (supplied or made up), since by the time those goals are proved the
  namespace will be cluttered still further.  Therefore, the final
  list of ``appropriate'' ~ilc[defthm] forms may be impossible to admit
  without some renaming by the user.  If you must invent new names,
  remember to substitute the new ones for the old ones in the ~c[:by]
  hints themselves.

  ~c[:RESTRICT]~nl[]
  Warning: This is a sophisticated hint, suggested by Bishop Brock, that is
  intended for advanced users.  In particular, ~c[:restrict] hints are ignored
  by the preprocessor, so you might find it useful to give the hint
  ~c[:do-not '(preprocess)] when using any ~c[:restrict] hints, at least if the
  rules in question are abbreviations (~pl[simple]).

  ~c[Value] is an association list.  Its members are of the form
  ~c[(x subst1 subst2 ...)], where: ~c[x] is either (1) a ~il[rune] whose
  ~ilc[car] is ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite] or ~c[:]~ilc[definition] or (2) an event name
  corresponding to one or more such ~il[rune]s; and ~c[(subst1 subst2 ...)] is
  a non-empty list of substitutions, i.e., of association lists pairing
  variables with terms.  First consider the case that ~c[x] is a
  ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite] or ~c[:]~ilc[definition] ~il[rune].  Recall that without
  this hint, the rule named ~c[x] is used by matching its left-hand side (call
  it ~c[lhs]) against the term currently being considered by the rewriter, that
  is, by attempting to find a substitution ~c[s] such that the instantiation of
  ~c[lhs] using ~c[s] is equal to that term.  If however the ~c[:restrict] hint
  contains ~c[(x subst1 subst2 ...)], then this behavior will be modified by
  restricting ~c[s] so that it must extend ~c[subst1]; and if there is no such
  ~c[s], then ~c[s] is restricted so that it must extend ~c[subst2]; and so on,
  until the list of substitutions is exhausted.  If no such ~c[s] is found,
  then the rewrite or definition rule named ~c[x] is not applied to that term.
  Finally, if ~c[x] is an event name corresponding to one or more
  ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite] or ~c[:]~ilc[definition] ~il[rune]s (that is, ~c[x] is the
  ``base symbol'' of such ~il[rune]s; ~pl[rune]), say ~il[rune]s ~c[r1],
  ... ~c[rn], then the meaning is the same except that
  ~c[(x subst1 subst2 ...)] is replaced by ~c[(ri subst1 subst2 ...)] for each
  ~c[i].  Once this replacement is complete, the hint may not contain two
  members whose ~ilc[car] is the same ~il[rune].

  Note that the substitutions in ~c[:restrict] hints refer to the
  variables actually appearing in the goals, not to the variables
  appearing in the rule being restricted.

  Here is an example, supplied by Bishop Brock.  Suppose that the
  database includes the following rewrite rule, which is probably kept
  ~il[disable]d.  (We ignore the question of how to prove this rule.)
  ~bv[]
  cancel-<-*$free:
  (implies (and (rationalp x)
                (rationalp y)
                (rationalp z))
           (equal (< y z)
                  (if (< x 0)
                      (> (* x y) (* x z))
                    (if (> x 0)
                        (< (* x y) (* x z))
                      (hide (< y z))))))
  ~ev[]
  Then ACL2 can prove the following theorem (unless other rules get in
  the way), essentially by multiplying both sides by ~c[x].
  ~bv[]
  (thm
    (implies (and (rationalp x)
                  (< 1 x))
             (< (/ x) 1))
    :hints
    ((\"Goal\"
      :in-theory (enable cancel-<-*$free)
      :restrict ((cancel-<-*$free ((x x) (y (/ x)) (z 1)))))))
  ~ev[]
  The ~c[:restrict] hint above says that the variables ~c[x], ~c[y], and ~c[z] in the
  rewrite rule ~c[cancel-<-*$free] above should be instantiated
  respectively by ~c[x], ~c[(/ x)], and ~c[1].  Thus ~c[(< y z)] becomes ~c[(< (/ x) 1)],
  and this inequality is replaced by the corresponding instance of the
  right-hand-side of ~c[cancel-<-*$free].  Since the current conjecture
  assumes ~c[(< 1 x)], that instance of the right-hand side simplifies to
  ~bv[]
  (< (* x (/ x)) (* x 1))
  ~ev[]
  which in turn simplifies to ~c[(< 1 x)], a hypothesis in the present
  theorem.

  ~c[:NONLINEARP]~nl[]
  ~c[Value] is ~c[t] or ~c[nil], indicating whether ~il[non-linear-arithmetic]
  is active.  The default value is ~c[nil].  ~l[non-linear-arithmetic].

  ~c[:BACKCHAIN-LIMIT-RW]~nl[]
  ~c[Value] is a natural number or ~c[nil], indicating the level of
  backchaining for ~il[rewrite], ~il[meta], and ~il[linear] rules.  This
  overrides, for the current goal and (as with ~c[:]~ilc[in-theory] hints)
  descendent goals, the default ~il[backchain-limit]
  (~pl[set-backchain-limit]).

  ~c[:REORDER]~nl[]
  ~c[Value] is a list of positive integers without duplicates, corresponding to
  the numbering of subgoals generated for the ~il[goal-spec] ~c[\"G\"], say
  ~c[\"G.k\"] down to ~c[\"G.1\"].  Those subgoals are reordered so that if
  ~c[value] is ~c[(n1 n2 ... nk)], then the goal now numbered ~c[\"G.k\"] will
  be the goal originally numbered ~c[\"G.n1\"]; the goal now numbered
  ~c[\"G.k-1\"] will be the goal formerly numbered ~c[\"G.n2\"]; and so on,
  down the list of ~c[ni], after which the goals not yet printed are printed in
  their original order.  Note that reordering for subgoals of a goal to be
  proved by induction, such as ~c[*1], is not supported.

  ~c[:CASE-SPLIT-LIMITATIONS]~nl[]
  ~c[Value] is the same as for ~ilc[set-case-split-limitations].  The
  simplifier will behave as though the value had instead been supplied to
  ~c[set-case-split-limitations]; ~pl[set-case-split-limitations].  This
  behavior will persist through subgoals unless overridden by another
  ~c[:CASE-SPLIT-LIMITATIONS] hint.

  ~c[:NO-OP]~nl[]
  ~c[Value] is any object and is irrelevant.  This hint does nothing.
  But empty hints, such as ~c[(\"Goal\")], are illegal and there are
  occasions, especially when writing custom keyword hints
  (~pl[custom-keyword-hints]) and computed hints (~pl[computed-hints])
  where it is convenient to be able to generate a non-empty no-op
  hint.  The standard idiom is ~c[(\"Goal\" :NO-OP T)] but the ~c[T]
  is completely ignored.  Unlike other hint keywords, multiple
  occurrences of the keyword ~c[:NO-OP] are tolerated.

  ~c[:NO-THANKS]~nl[]
  ~c[Value] is any object.  This hint does nothing, except that if
  ~c[value] is non-~c[nil] then the usual ``[Note:  A hint was
  supplied... Thanks!]'' is not printed.

  ~c[:ERROR]~nl[]
  ~c[Value] is typically a ``fmt message'' to be printed by the
  ~ilc[fmt] tilde-directive ~~@ but may be any object.  The effect
  of this hint is to cause an error when the hint is translated.
  There is no reason to include an ~c[:ERROR] hint in any user-typein,
  since it will only cause an error when the form is evaluated.
  ~c[:ERROR] hints are useful in the definition of functions that
  generate custom keyword hints (~il[custom-keyword-hints]) and
  computed hints (~il[computed-hints]).  For example, if you wish
  to define a custom keyword hint ~c[:my-hint val] and you wish the
  hint to signal an error if there is something inappropriate about
  ~c[val] in the context of the hint, use the following code to generate
  the hint
  ~bv[]
  (list :ERROR (cons \"Your specified value, ~~x0, is inappropriate\"
                     (list (cons \#0 val))))
  ~ev[]
  which is equivalent to
  ~bv[]
  (list :ERROR (msg \"Your specified value, ~~x0, is inappropriate\"
                    val))
  ~ev[]
  which, if ~c[val] has the value ~c[123], would evaluate to the hint
  ~bv[]
  (:ERROR (\"Your specified value, ~~x0, is inappropriate\" (\#0 . 123))).
  ~ev[]
  Note that any time an ~c[:ERROR] keyword is produced during hint processing,
  including iterations of the expansions of custom keyword hints or of
  ~il[override-hints], an error will occur.

  ~c[:OR]~nl[]
  ~c[Value] is a list ~c[(kwd-val-listp-1 ... kwd-val-listp-k)], where each
  ~c[kwd-val-listp-i] is a list satisfying ~ilc[keyword-value-listp], i.e., an
  alternating list of keywords and values.  This hint causes an attempt to
  prove the specified goal using hints ~c[kwd-val-listp-i] in sequence (first
  ~c[kwd-val-listp-1], then ~c[kwd-val-listp-2], and so on), until the first of
  these succeeds.  If none succeeds, then the prover proceeds after
  heuristically choosing the ``best'' result, taking into account the goals
  pushed in each case for proof by induction.

  The following (contrived but illustrative example illustrates how ~c[:or]
  hints work.
  ~bv[]
    ACL2 !>(thm (f x)
                :hints
                ((\"Goal\"
                  :expand ((nth x 3))
                  :or ((:in-theory (disable car-cons))
                       (:use cdr-cons :in-theory (enable append)))
                  :do-not '(generalize))))

    [Note:  A hint was supplied for our processing of the goal above.
    Thanks!]

    The :OR hint for Goal gives rise to two disjunctive branches.  Proving
    any one of these branches would suffice to prove Goal.  We explore
    them in turn, describing their derivations as we go.

    ---
    Subgoal D2
    ( same formula as Goal ).

    The first disjunctive branch (of 2) for Goal can be created by applying
    the hint:
    (\"Subgoal D2\" :EXPAND ((NTH X 3))
                  :IN-THEORY (DISABLE CAR-CONS)
                  :DO-NOT '(GENERALIZE)).


    [Note:  A hint was supplied for our processing of the goal above.
    Thanks!]

    Normally we would attempt to prove this formula by induction.  However,
    we prefer in this instance to focus on the original input conjecture
    rather than this simplified special case.  We therefore abandon our
    previous work on this conjecture and reassign the name *1 to the original
    conjecture.  (See :DOC otf-flg.)  [Note:  Thanks again for the hint.]

    ---
    Subgoal D1
    ( same formula as Goal ).

    The second disjunctive branch (of 2) for Goal can be created by applying
    the hint:
    (\"Subgoal D1\" :EXPAND ((NTH X 3))
                  :USE CDR-CONS
                  :IN-THEORY (ENABLE APPEND)
                  :DO-NOT '(GENERALIZE)).


    [Note:  A hint was supplied for our processing of the goal above.
    Thanks!]

    ACL2 Warning [Use] in ( THM ...):  It is unusual to :USE an enabled
    :REWRITE or :DEFINITION rule, so you may want to consider disabling
    (:REWRITE CDR-CONS).


    We augment the goal with the hypothesis provided by the :USE hint.
    The hypothesis can be obtained from CDR-CONS.  We are left with the
    following subgoal.

    Subgoal D1'
    (IMPLIES (EQUAL (CDR (CONS X Y)) Y)
             (F X)).

    By the simple :rewrite rule CDR-CONS we reduce the conjecture to

    Subgoal D1''
    (F X).
  ~ev[]
  ... and so on.  This example illustrates how ACL2 processes ~c[:or] hints in
  general.  For each ~c[i] from 1 to ~c[k], a so-called ``disjunctive'' subgoal
  is created by splicing ~c[kwd-val-listp-i] into the other hint values (if
  any) supplied for the given goal, in order.  A corresponding subgoal is
  created for each ~c[i], numbered in the usual manner (hence, counting down)
  except that the ``~c[D]'' is prefixed to each resulting goal.

  ~c[:RW-CACHE-STATE]~nl[]
  ~c[Value] is an element of the list constant ~c[*legal-rw-cache-states*]:
  ~c[:atom] (the default), ~c[nil], ~c[t], or ~c[:disabled].  This hint applies
  to the indicated goal and all its descendents, to set the so-called
  ``rw-cache-state'' to the indicated value; ~pl[set-rw-cache-state].

  ~c[:BACKTRACK]~nl[]
  This is an advanced hint.  You can probably accomplish its effect by the use
  of ordinary computed hints; ~pl[computed-hints].  But if you are an expert,
  read on.  (~l[hints-and-the-waterfall] for some relevant background.)

  ~c[Value] is a computed hint, which is an expression that evaluates either to
  ~c[nil] ~-[] indicating that the ~c[:backtrack] hint is to have no effect
  ~-[] or to a non-empty alternating list of ~c[:keyi :vali] pairs, as expected
  for a hint.  However, unlike ordinary computed hints, ~c[:backtrack] hints
  are evaluated ~st[after] a goal has been processed to yield zero or more
  subgoals, not before.  Moreover, variables ~c[PROCESSOR] and ~c[CLAUSE-LIST]
  are allowed, but variable ~c[STABLE-UNDER-SIMPLIFICATIONP] is not.  We
  explain in more detail below, but first consider the following simple
  example.  First we define a standard list reversal function:
  ~bv[]
  (defun rev (x)
    (if (consp x)
        (append (rev (cdr x)) (cons (car x) nil))
      nil))
  ~ev[]
  Now we prove:
  ~bv[]
  (thm (true-listp (rev x)))
  ~ev[]
  The successful proof includes the following output.
  ~bv[]
  Subgoal *1/1'
  (IMPLIES
    (AND (CONSP X)
         (TRUE-LISTP (REV (CDR X))))
    (TRUE-LISTP (APPEND (REV (CDR X)) (LIST (CAR X))))).

  The destructor terms (CAR X) and (CDR X) can be
  eliminated by using CAR-CDR-ELIM to replace X
  by (CONS X1 X2), (CAR X) by X1 and (CDR X) by
  X2.  This produces the following goal.

  Subgoal *1/1''
  (IMPLIES (AND (CONSP (CONS X1 X2))
                (TRUE-LISTP (REV X2)))
           (TRUE-LISTP (APPEND (REV X2) (LIST X1)))).
  ~ev[]
  But suppose that we attach a ~c[:backtrack] hint to the goal above at which
  destructor elimination was applied:
  ~bv[]
  (thm (true-listp (rev x))
       :hints ((\"Subgoal *1/1'\"
                :backtrack
                (quote (:do-not '(eliminate-destructors))))))
  ~ev[]
  Then when ACL2 applies destructor elimination as displayed above, this time
  the ~c[:backtrack] hint applies, evaluating to
  ~c[(:do-not '(eliminate-destructors))].  Since this list is not ~c[nil], the
  prover decides not to keep the new subgoal, and instead supplies this
  ~c[:do-not] hint before attacking the goal again.  In this example, ACL2
  happens to use a technique later in its ``waterfall'' arsenal than destructor
  elimination, namely, generalization:
  ~bv[]
  Subgoal *1/1'
  (IMPLIES
    (AND (CONSP X)
         (TRUE-LISTP (REV (CDR X))))
    (TRUE-LISTP (APPEND (REV (CDR X)) (LIST (CAR X))))).

  [Note:  A hint was supplied for our processing
  of the goal above, because of a :backtrack hint
  that is preventing destructor elimination.
  Thanks!]

  We generalize this conjecture, replacing
  (REV (CDR X)) by RV.  This produces

  Subgoal *1/1''
  (IMPLIES (AND (CONSP X) (TRUE-LISTP RV))
           (TRUE-LISTP (APPEND RV (LIST (CAR X))))).
  ~ev[]

  We now provide a careful explanation of how ~c[:backtrack] hints work, but we
  suggest that you keep the example above in mind.  If ``~c[:backtrack form]''
  is part of the hint that has been selected for a goal, then ~c[form] is
  evaluated when one of ACL2's clause processors successfully applies to the
  current goal to produce a list of subgoals.  This evaluation takes place in
  an environment just like that for any computed hint (~pl[computed-hints]),
  with the following exceptions.  First, the variable
  ~c[STABLE-UNDER-SIMPLIFICATIONP] is not allowed to occur free in ~c[form],
  but instead the following new variables are allowed to occur free and are
  bound for this evaluation as follows: ~c[PROCESSOR] is bound to the processor
  in the list ~c[*preprocess-clause-ledge*] that has applied to the goal, and
  ~c[CLAUSE-LIST] is bound to the list of clauses (each a list of literals that
  is implicitly disjoined) returned by that clause processor.  Second, the
  variables ~c[HIST] and ~c[PSPV] are bound to the history and pspv returned by
  the clause processor, ~st[not] the ones that were passed to the clause
  processor.  If this evaluation returns an error, then the proof aborts, as
  for any computed hint whose evaluation returns an error.  If this evaluation
  returns ~c[nil], then the ~c[:backtrack] hint has no effect, and the goal is
  replaced by the list of goals (the value of ~c[CLAUSE-LIST] described above),
  as usual.  Otherwise, the clause processor is deemed to have failed, and the
  goal clause is tried again starting at the top of the waterfall after
  selecting the hint returned by the above evaluation.  That hint will normally
  be an alternating list of hint keywords and their values, but if it is a
  custom keyword hint (~pl[custom-keyword-hints]), then it will be handled in
  the usual manner but with the first three variables above bound to the symbol
  ~c[:OMITTED].  Of course, if the new hint includes a value for ~c[:BACKTRACK]
  then this process can loop; care should be taken to keep that from happening.

  A final note about ~c[:BACKTRACK] hints: since these are a form of computed
  hints, ~il[override-hints] (if any) are applied to their evaluation result
  just as with any computed hint.  That is, the backtrack hint is successively
  modified with each override-hint, to produce a final hint that is actually
  used (or, ignored if that final hint is ~c[nil]).  ~l[override-hints].~/")

  the internal form of a ~il[goal-spec]~/

  To each goal-spec, ~c[str], there corresponds a clause-identifier
  produced by ~c[(parse-clause-id str)].  For example,
  ~bv[]
  (parse-clause-id \"[2]Subgoal *4.5.6/7.8.9'''\")
  ~ev[]
  returns ~c[((2 4 5 6) (7 8 9) . 3)].

  The function ~c[string-for-tilde-@-clause-id-phrase] inverts
  ~c[parse-clause-id] in the sense that given a clause identifier it
  returns the corresponding goal-spec.~/

  As noted in the documentation for ~il[goal-spec], each clause
  printed in the theorem prover's proof attempt is identified by a
  name.  When these names are represented as strings they are called
  ``goal specs.''  Such strings are used to specify where in the proof
  attempt a given hint is to be applied.  The function
  ~c[parse-clause-id] converts goal-specs into clause identifiers,
  which are cons-trees containing natural numbers.

  Examples of goal-specs and their corresponding clause identifiers
  are shown below.
  ~bv[]

  The caar of a clause id specifies the forcing round, the cdar
  specifies the goal being proved by induction, the cadr specifies the
  particular subgoal, and the cddr is the number of primes in that
  subgoal.

  Internally, the system maintains clause ids, not goal-specs.  The
  system prints clause ids in the form shown by goal-specs.  When a
  goal-spec is used in a hint, it is parsed (before the proof attempt
  begins) into a clause id.  During the proof attempt, the system
  watches for the clause id and uses the corresponding hint when the
  id arises.  (Because of the expense of creating and garbage
  collecting a lot of strings, this design is more efficient than the
  alternative.)")

  ~bv[]
  General Form of :hints:
  (hint1 hint2 ... hintk)
  ~ev[]
  Each element, hinti, must be either a common hint or a computed hint.~/

  A common hint is of the form
  ~bv[]
  (goal-spec :key1 val1 ... :keyn valn)
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[goal-spec] is as specified in ~il[goal-spec] and each ~c[:keyi] and
  ~c[vali] is as specified in ~il[hints].  Among the ``common hints'' we
  include both the primitive hints and user-defined custom keyword hints
  (~pl[custom-keyword-hints]).

  A computed hint may be a function symbol, ~c[fn], of three, four or seven
  arguments.  Otherwise, a computed hint is a term with the following
  properties:

  (a) the only free variables allowed in the term are ~c[ID], ~c[CLAUSE],
  ~c[WORLD], ~c[STABLE-UNDER-SIMPLIFICATIONP], ~c[HIST], ~c[PSPV], ~c[CTX], and
  ~ilc[STATE];

  (b) the output signature of the term is either ~c[(MV * * STATE)], which is
  to be treated as an error triple (see below), or is ~c[*], denoting a single
  non-~il[stobj] value; and

  (c) in the former case of (b) above, the term is single-threaded in
  ~ilc[STATE].

  If a computed hint is a function symbol ~c[fn], whose arity n is therefore
  three, four, or seven, then it is treated as the term resulting from applying
  that ~c[fn] to the first n variables shown in (a) above.  Notice that it must
  then return a single non-~il[stobj] value, not an error triple, since
  ~c[state] is not one of the first seven variables shown in (a).

  Note: Error triples are an ACL2 idiom for implementing ``errors'';
  ~pl[error-triples].  If a computation returns ~c[(mv erp val state)] in a
  context in which ACL2 is respecting the error triple
  convention (~pl[ld-error-triples] and ~pl[ld-error-action]), then an error is
  deemed to have occurred if ~c[erp] is non-~c[nil].  The computation is
  expected to have printed an appropriate error message to ~ilc[state] and
  further computation is aborted.  On the other hand, if a computation returns
  an error triple in which ~c[erp] is nil, then ``value'' of the computation is
  taken to be the second component, ~c[val], of the triple (along with the
  possibly modified ~ilc[state]), and computation continues.  For more
  information about programming with error triples,
  ~pl[programming-with-state].

  The function symbol cases are treated as abbreviations of the term
  ~c[(fn ID CLAUSE WORLD)],
  ~c[(fn ID CLAUSE WORLD STABLE-UNDER-SIMPLIFICATIONP)], or
  ~c[(fn ID CLAUSE WORLD STABLE-UNDER-SIMPLIFICATIONP HIST PSPV CTX)]
  as appropriate for the arity of ~c[fn].  (Note that this tells you which
  argument of ~c[fn] is which.)  Moreover, in these cases the value returned
  must be a single ordinary (non-~il[stobj]) value, not an error triple.  In
  the discussion below we assume all computed hints are of the term form.
  Indeed, we almost assume all computed hints are of the 3 and 4 argument
  forms.  We only comment briefly on the 7 argument form in
  ~il[using-computed-hints-8].

  The semantics of a computed hint term is as follows.  On every subgoal, the
  term is evaluated in an environment in which the variables mentioned in (a)
  above are bound to context-sensitive values explained below.  Either the
  computed hint signals an error, in which the proof attempt aborts, or else it
  returns a value, ~c[val] and a new state, ~ilc[state].  Any changes to those
  parts of ~ilc[state] that affect logical soundness are undone; more
  specifically, the values of symbols (sometimes called ``state global
  variables'') in the list ~c[*protected-system-state-globals*] in the global
  table of the state (~pl[state]) are restored when changed during evaluation.
  The value, ~c[val], of a non-erroneous computed hint calculation is either
  ~c[nil], which means the computed hint did not apply to the subgoal in
  question, or it is an alternating list of ~c[:keyi vali] pairs as specified
  in ~il[hints].  With one exception, those new hints are applied to the given
  subgoal as though the user had typed them explicitly.

  The exception is that the first keyword in the returned ~c[val] is allowed to
  be ~c[:COMPUTED-HINT-REPLACEMENT].  Its value should be ~c[nil], ~c[t], or a
  list of terms.  If this keyword is not present, the default value of ~c[nil]
  is provided.  We explain ~c[:COMPUTED-HINT-REPLACEMENT] below.

  The evaluation of a hint term is done with guard checking turned off
  (~pl[set-guard-checking]); e.g., the form ~c[(car 23)] in a
  computed hint returns ~c[nil] as per the axioms.

  When a non-~c[nil] value is returned, the keyword/value pairs (other than the
  optional ~c[:COMPUTED-HINT-REPLACEMENT]) are used as the hint for the subgoal
  in question.  Thus, your job as the programmer of computed hints is either to
  cause an error, typically by invoking ~ilc[er], or to return a non-erroneous
  value triple whose value is the list of keys and values you would have typed
  had you supplied a common hint for the subgoal. (In particular, any theory
  expressions in it are evaluated with respect to the global current-theory,
  not whatever theory is active at the subgoal in question.)  If the generated
  list of keywords and values is illegal, an error will be signaled and the
  proof attempt will be aborted.

  The purpose of the ~c[:COMPUTED-HINT-REPLACEMENT] keyword and its value,
  ~c[chr], is to change the list of hints.  If ~c[chr] is ~c[nil], then the
  hint which was applied is removed from the list of hints that is passed down
  to the children of the subgoal in question.  This is the default.  If ~c[chr]
  is ~c[t], then the hint is left in the list of hints.  This means that the
  same hint may act on the children of the subgoal.  Otherwise, ~c[chr] must be
  a list of terms, each of which is treated as a computed hint.  The hint which
  was applied is deleted from the list of hints and the hints in ~c[chr] are
  added to the list of hints passed to the children of the subgoal.  The
  ability to compute new hints and pass them down allows strange and wonderful
  behavior.

  For these purposes, the goals produced by induction and the top-level goals
  of forcing rounds are not considered children; all original hints are
  available to them.

  Only the first hint applicable to a goal, as specified in the user-supplied
  list of ~c[:hints] followed by the ~ilc[default-hints-table], will be applied
  to that goal.  (For an advanced exception, ~pl[override-hints].)

  It remains only to describe the bindings of the free variables.

  Suppose the theorem prover is working on some clause, clause, named by some
  ~ilc[goal-spec], e.g., \"Subgoal *1/2'''\" in some logical world, world.
  Corresponding to the printed ~c[goal-spec] is an internal data structure
  called a ``clause identifier'' id.  ~l[clause-identifier].

  In the case of a common hint, the hint applies if the goal-spec of the hint
  is the same as the goal-spec of the clause in question.

  In the case of a computed hint, the variable ~c[ID] is bound to the clause
  id, the variable ~c[CLAUSE] is bound to the (translated form of the) clause,
  and the variable ~c[WORLD] is bound to the current ACL2 world.  The variable
  ~c[STABLE-UNDER-SIMPLIFICATIONP] is bound to ~c[t] or ~c[nil].  It is bound
  to ~c[t] only if the clause is known to be stable under simplification.  That
  is, the simplifier has been applied to the clause and did not change it.
  Such a clause is sometimes known as a ``simplification checkpoint.''  It is
  frequently useful to inject hints (e.g., to enable a rule or provide a
  ~c[:use] hint) only when the goal in question has stabilized.  If a hint is
  provided, the processing of the clause starts over with simplification.

  As for ~c[CTX] and ~ilc[STATE], they are provided so that you can pass them
  to the ~ilc[er] macro to print error messages.  We recommend not writing
  computed hints that otherwise change ~ilc[STATE]!

  The remaining variables, ~c[HIST] and ~c[PSPV] are not documented yet.  Only
  users familiar with the internals of ACL2 are likely to need them or
  understand their values.

  One Hint to Every Top-Level Goal in a Forcing Round~/~/

  Suppose the main proof completes with a forcing round on three
  subgoals, \"[1]Subgoal 3\", \"[1]Subgoal 2\", and \"[1]Subgoal 1\".
  Suppose you wish to ~c[:use lemma42] in all top-level goals of the
  first forcing round.  This can be done supplying the hint
  ~bv[]
  (if test '(:use lemma42) nil),
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[test] is an expression that returns
  ~c[t] when ~c[ID] is one of the clause ids in question.
  ~bv[]
      goal-spec     (parse-clause-id goal-spec)

  \"[1]Subgoal 3\"        ((1) (3) . 0)
  \"[1]Subgoal 2\"        ((1) (2) . 0)
  \"[1]Subgoal 1\"        ((1) (1) . 0)
  ~ev[]
  Recall (~pl[clause-identifier]) that ~c[parse-clause-id] maps
  from a goal spec to a clause id, so you can use that function on the
  goal specs printed in the failed proof attempt to determine the
  clause ids in question.

  So one acceptable ~c[test] is
  ~bv[]
  (member-equal id '(((1) (3) . 0)
                     ((1) (2) . 0)
                     ((1) (1) . 0)))
  ~ev[]
  or you could use ~c[parse-clause-id] in your computed hint if you
  don't want to see clause ids in your script:
  ~bv[]
  (or (equal id (parse-clause-id \"[1]Subgoal 3\"))
      (equal id (parse-clause-id \"[1]Subgoal 2\"))
      (equal id (parse-clause-id \"[1]Subgoal 1\")))
  ~ev[]
  or you could use the inverse function (~pl[clause-identifier]):
  ~bv[]
  (member-equal (string-for-tilde-@-clause-id-phrase id)
                '(\"[1]Subgoal 3\"
                  \"[1]Subgoal 2\"
                  \"[1]Subgoal 1\"))
  ~ev[]

  Recall that what we've shown above are the tests to use in the
  computed hint.  The hint itself is ~c[(if test '(:use lemma42) nil)]
  or something equivalent like ~c[(and test '(:use lemma42))].

  The three tests above are all equivalent.  They suffer from the
  problem of requiring the explicit enumeration of all the goal specs
  in the first forcing round.  A change in the script might cause more
  forced subgoals and the ones other than those enumerated would not
  be given the hint.

  You could write a test that recognizes all first round top-level
  subgoals no matter how many there are.  Just think of the
  programming problem:  how do I recognize all the clause id's of the
  form ~c[((1) (n) . 0)]?  Often you can come to this formulation of
  the problem by using ~c[parse-clause-id] on a few of the candidate
  goal-specs to see the common structure.  A suitable test in this
  case is:
  ~bv[]
  (and (equal (car id) '(1))     ; forcing round 1, top-level (pre-induction)
       (equal (len (cadr id)) 1) ; Subgoal n (not Subgoal n.i ...)
       (equal (cddr id) 0))      ; no primes
  ~ev[]

  The test above is ``overkill'' because it recognizes precisely the
  clause ids in question.  But recall that once a computed hint is
  used, it is (by default) removed from the hints available to the
  children of the clause.  Thus, we can widen the set of clause ids
  recognized to include all the children without worrying that the
  hint will be applied to those children.

  In particular, the following test supplies the hint to every
  top-level goal of the first forcing round:
  ~bv[]
  (equal (car id) '(1))
  ~ev[]
  You might worry that it would also supply the hint to the subgoal
  produced by the hint -- the cases we ruled out by the ``overkill''
  above.  But that doesn't happen since the hint is unavailable to the
  children.  You could even write:
  ~bv[]
  (equal (car (car id)) 1)
  ~ev[]
  which would supply the hint to every goal of the form \"[1]Subgoal ...\"
  and again, because we see and fire on the top-level goals first, we
  will not fire on, say, \"[1]Subgoal *1.3/2\", i.e., the id '((1 1 3)
  (2) . 0) even though the test recognizes that id.

  Finally, the following test supplies the hint to every top-level goal
  of every forcing round (except the 0th, which is the ``gist'' of the
  proof, not ``really'' a forcing round):
  ~bv[]
  (not (equal (car (car id)) 0))
  ~ev[]

  Recall again that in all the examples above we have exhibited the
  ~c[test] in a computed hint of the form ~c[(if test '(:key1 val1 ...) nil)].")

  Hints as a Function of the Goal (not its Name)~/~/

  Sometimes it is desirable to supply a hint whenever a certain term
  arises in a conjecture.  For example, suppose we have proved
  ~bv[]
  (defthm all-swaps-have-the-property
     (the-property (swap x))
     :rule-classes nil)
  ~ev[]
  and suppose that whenever ~c[(SWAP A)] occurs in a goal, we wish to
  add the additional hypothesis that ~c[(THE-PROPERTY (SWAP A))].
  Note that this is equivalent supplying the hint
  ~bv[]
  (if test
      '(:use (:instance all-swaps-have-the-property (x A)))
      nil)
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[test] answers the question ``does the clause contain ~c[(SWAP A)]?''
  That question can be asked with ~c[(occur-lst '(SWAP A) clause)].
  Briefly, ~c[occur-lst] takes the representation of a translated term,
  x, and a list of translated terms, y, and determines whether x
  occurs as a subterm of any term in y.  (By ``subterm'' here we mean
  proper or improper, e.g., the subterms of ~c[(CAR X)] are ~c[X] and
  ~c[(CAR X)].)

  Thus, the computed hint:
  ~bv[]
  (if (occur-lst '(swap a) clause)
      '(:use (:instance all-swaps-have-the-property (x A)))
      nil)
  ~ev[]
  will add the hypothesis ~c[(THE-PROPERTY (SWAP A))] to every goal
  containing ~c[(SWAP A)] -- except the children of goals to which the
  hypothesis was added.

  ~b[A COMMON MISTAKE] users are likely to make is to forget that they
  are dealing with translated terms.  For example, suppose we wished
  to look for ~c[(SWAP (LIST 1 A))] with ~c[occur-lst].  We would never
  find it with
  ~bv[]
  (occur-lst '(SWAP (LIST 1 A)) clause)
  ~ev[]
  because that presentation of the term contains macros and other
  abbreviations.  By using :trans (~pl[trans]) we can obtain the
  translation of the target term.  Then we can look for it with:
  ~bv[]
  (occur-lst '(SWAP (CONS '1 (CONS A 'NIL))) clause)
  ~ev[]
  Note in particular that you must
  ~bf[]
  * eliminate all macros and
  * explicitly quote all constants.
  ~ef[]
  We recommend using ~c[:trans] to obtain the translated form of the
  terms in which you are interested, before programming your hints.

  An alternative is to use the expression
  ~c[(prettyify-clause clause nil nil)] in your hint to convert the
  current goal clause into the s-expression that is actually printed.
  For example, the clause
  ~bv[]
  ((NOT (CONSP X)) (SYMBOLP Y) (EQUAL (CONS '1 (CAR X)) Y))
  ~ev[]
  ``prettyifies'' to
  ~bv[]
  (IMPLIES (AND (CONSP X)
                (NOT (SYMBOLP Y)))
           (EQUAL (CONS 1 (CAR X)) Y))
  ~ev[]
  which is what you would see printed by ACL2 when the goal clause is
  that shown.

  However, if you choose to convert your clauses to prettyified form,
  you will have to write your own explorers (like our ~c[occur-lst]),
  because all of the ACL2 term processing utilities work on translated
  and/or clausal forms.  This should not be taken as a terrible
  burden.  You will, at least, gain the benefit of knowing what you
  are really looking for, because your explorers will be looking at
  exactly the s-expressions you see at your terminal.  And you won't
  have to wade through our still undocumented term/clause utilities.
  The approach will slow things down a little, since you will be
  paying the price of independently consing up the prettyified term.

  We make one more note on this example.  We said above that
  the computed hint:
  ~bv[]
  (if (occur-lst '(swap a) clause)
      '(:use (:instance all-swaps-have-the-property (x A)))
      nil)
  ~ev[]
  will add the hypothesis ~c[(THE-PROPERTY (SWAP A))] to every goal
  containing ~c[(SWAP A)] -- except the children of goals to which the
  hypothesis was added.

  It bears noting that the subgoals produced by induction and
  top-level forcing round goals are not children.  For example,
  suppose the hint above fires on \"Subgoal 3\" and produces, say,
  \"Subgoal 3'\".  Then the hint will not fire on \"Subgoal 3'\" even
  though it (still) contains ~c[(SWAP A)] because \"Subgoal 3'\" is a
  child of a goal on which the hint fired.

  But now suppose that \"Subgoal 3'\" is pushed for induction.  Then
  the goals created by that induction, i.e., the base case and
  induction step, are not considered children of \"Subgoal 3'\".  All
  of the original hints are available.

  Alternatively, suppose that \"Subgoal 3'\ is proved but forces some
  other subgoal, \"[1]Subgoal 1\" which is attacked in Forcing Round
  1.  That top-level forced subgoal is not a child.  All the original
  hints are available to it.  Thus, if it contains ~c[(SWAP A)], the
  hint will fire and supply the hypothesis, producing \"[1]Subgoal
  1'\".  This may be unnecessary, as the hypothesis might already be
  present in \"[1]Subgoal 1\".  In this case, no harm is done.  The
  hint won't fire on \"[1]Subgoal 1\" because it is a child of
  \"[1]Subgoal 1\" and the hint fired on that.")

  Computing the Hints~/~/

  So far we have used computed hints only to compute when a fixed set
  of keys and values are to be used as a hint.  But computed hints
  can, of course, compute the set of keys and values.  You might, for
  example, write a hint that recognizes when a clause ``ought'' to be
  provable by a ~c[:BDD] hint and generate the appropriate hint.  You
  might build in a set of useful lemmas and check to see if the clause
  is provable ~c[:BY] one of them.  You can keep all function symbols
  disabled and use computed hints to compute which ones you want to
  ~c[:EXPAND].  In general, you can write a theorem prover for use in
  your hints, provided you can get it to do its job by directing our
  theorem prover.

  Suppose for example we wish to find every occurrence of an instance
  of ~c[(SWAP x)] and provide the corresponding instance of
  ~c[ALL-SWAPS-HAVE-THE-PROPERTY].  Obviously, we must explore the
  clause looking for instances of ~c[(SWAP x)] and build the
  appropriate instances of the lemma.  We could do this in many
  different ways, but below we show a general purpose set of utilities
  for doing it.  The functions are not defined in ACL2 but could be
  defined as shown.

  Our plan is:  (1) Find all instances of a given pattern (term) in a
  clause, obtaining a set of substitutions.  (2) Build a set of
  ~c[:instance] expressions for a given lemma name and set of
  substitutions.  (3) Generate a ~c[:use] hint for those instances when
  instances are found.

  The pair of functions below find all instances of a given pattern
  term in either a term or a list of terms.  The functions each return
  a list of substitutions, each substitution accounting for one of the
  matches of pat to a subterm.  At this level in ACL2 substitutions
  are lists of pairs of the form ~c[(var . term)].  All terms mentioned
  here are presumed to be in translated form.

  The functions take as their third argument a list of substitutions
  accumulated to date and add to it the substitutions produced by
  matching pat to the subterms of the term.  We intend this
  accumulator to be nil initially.  If the returned value is nil, then
  no instances of pat occurred.

  ~bv[]
  (mutual-recursion

  (defun find-all-instances (pat term alists)
   (declare (xargs :mode :program))
   (mv-let
    (instancep alist)
    (one-way-unify pat term)
    (let ((alists (if instancep (add-to-set-equal alist alists) alists)))
      (cond
       ((variablep term) alists)
       ((fquotep term) alists)
       (t (find-all-instances-list pat (fargs term) alists))))))

  (defun find-all-instances-list (pat list-of-terms alists)
   (declare (xargs :mode :program))
   (cond
    ((null list-of-terms) alists)
    (t (find-all-instances pat
                           (car list-of-terms)
                           (find-all-instances-list pat
                                                    (cdr list-of-terms)
                                                    alists))))))
  ~ev[]

  Caveat: The following aside has nothing to do with computed hints.  Does an
  instance of ~c[(CAR (CDR x))] occur in ~c[((LAMBDA (V) (CAR V)) (CDR A))]?
  It does if one beta-reduces the lambda-expression to ~c[(CAR (CDR A))];
  the appropriate substitution is to replace ~c[x] by ~c[A].  But the
  definition of ~c[find-all-instances] above does ~i[not] find this instance
  because it does not do beta-reduction.

  We now turn our attention to converting a list of substitutions into
  a list of lemma instances, each of the form
  ~bv[]
  (:INSTANCE name (var1 term1) ... (vark termk))
  ~ev[]
  as written in ~c[:use] hints.  In the code shown above, substitutions
  are lists of pairs of the form ~c[(var . term)], but in lemma
  instances we must write ``doublets.''  So here we show how to
  convert from one to the other:
  ~bv[]
  (defun pairs-to-doublets (alist)
    (declare (xargs :mode :program))
    (cond ((null alist) nil)
          (t (cons (list (caar alist) (cdar alist))
                   (pairs-to-doublets (cdr alist))))))
  ~ev[]

  Now we can make a list of lemma instances:
  ~bv[]
  (defun make-lemma-instances (name alists)
    (declare (xargs :mode :program))
    (cond
     ((null alists) nil)
     (t (cons (list* :instance name (pairs-to-doublets (car alists)))
              (make-lemma-instances name (cdr alists))))))
  ~ev[]

  Finally, we can package it all together into a hint function.  The
  function takes a pattern, ~c[pat], which must be a translated term,
  the name of a lemma, ~c[name], and a clause.  If some instances of
  ~c[pat] occur in ~c[clause], then the corresponding instances of
  ~c[name] are ~c[:USE]d in the computed hint.  Otherwise, the hint does
  not apply.
  ~bv[]
  (defun add-corresponding-instances (pat name clause)
    (declare (xargs :mode :program))
    (let ((alists (find-all-instances-list pat clause nil)))
      (cond
       ((null alists) nil)
       (t (list :use (make-lemma-instances name alists))))))
  ~ev[]
  The design of this particular hint function makes it important that
  the variables of the pattern be the variables of the named lemma and
  that all of the variables we wish to instantiate occur in the
  pattern.  We could, of course, redesign it to allow ``free
  variables'' or some sort of renaming.

  We could now use this hint as shown below:
  ~bv[]
  (defthm ... ...
    :hints ((add-corresponding-instances
             '(SWAP x)
             'ALL-SWAPS-HAVE-THE-PROPERTY
             clause)))
  ~ev[]
  The effect of the hint above is that any time a clause arises in
  which any instance of ~c[(SWAP x)] appears, we add the corresponding
  instance of ~c[ALL-SWAPS-HAVE-THE-PROPERTY].  So for example, if
  Subgoal *1/3.5 contains the subterm ~c[(SWAP (SWAP A))] then this
  hint fires and makes the system behave as though the hint:
  ~bv[]
  (\"Subgoal *1/3.5\"
   :USE ((:INSTANCE ALL-SWAPS-HAVE-THE-PROPERTY (X A))
         (:INSTANCE ALL-SWAPS-HAVE-THE-PROPERTY (X (SWAP A)))))
  ~ev[]
  had been present.")

  Debugging Computed Hints~/~/

  We have found that it is sometimes helpful to define hints so that
  they print out messages to the terminal when they fire, so you can
  see what hint was generated and which of your computed hints did it.

  To that end we have defined a macro we sometimes use.  Suppose you
  have a ~c[:hints] specification such as:
  ~bv[]
  :hints (computed-hint-fn (hint-expr id))
  ~ev[]
  If you defmacro the macro below you could then write instead:
  ~bv[]
  :hints ((show-hint computed-hint-fn 1)
          (show-hint (hint-expr id) 2))
  ~ev[]
  with the effect that whenever either hint is fired (i.e., returns
  non-~c[nil]), a message identifying the hint by the marker (1 or 2,
  above) and the non-~c[nil] value is printed.

  ~bv[]
  (defmacro show-hint (hint &optional marker)
    (cond
     ((and (consp hint)
           (stringp (car hint)))
      hint)
     (t
      `(let ((marker ,marker)
             (ans ,(if (symbolp hint)
                       `(,hint id clause world stable-under-simplificationp)
                     hint)))
         (if ans
             (prog2$
              (cw \"~~%***** Computed Hint~~#0~~[~~/ (from hint ~~x1)~~]~~%~~x2~~%~~%\"
                  (if (null marker) 0 1)
                  marker
                  (cons (string-for-tilde-@-clause-id-phrase id)
                        ans))
              ans)
           nil)))))
  ~ev[]
  Note that when ~c[show-hint] is applied to a hint that is a symbol,
  e.g., ~c[computed-hint-fn], it applies the symbol to the four
  computed-hint arguments: ~c[id], ~c[clause], ~c[world], and
  ~c[stable-under-simplificationp].  If ~c[computed-hint-fn] is of
  arity 3 the code above would cause an error.  One way to avoid it
  is to write
  ~bv[]
  :hints ((show-hints (computed-hint-fn id clause world) 1)
          (show-hint (hint-expr id) 2)).
  ~ev[]
  If you only use computed hints of arity 3, you might eliminate
  the occurrence of ~c[stable-under-simplificationp] in the definition
  of ~c[show-hint] above.

  Putting a ~c[show-hint] around a common hint has no effect.  If you
  find yourself using this utility let us know and we'll consider
  putting it into the system itself.  But it does illustrate that you
  can use computed hints to do unusual things.")

  Using the computed-hint-replacement feature~/~/

  So far none of our computed hints have used the
  ~c[:COMPUTED-HINT-REPLACEMENT] feature.  We now illustrate that.

  The ~c[:computed-hint-replacement] feature can easily lead to loops.
  So as you experiment with the examples in this section and your own
  hints using this feature, be ready to interrupt the theorem prover
  and abort!

  A non-looping use of the ~c[:computed-hint-replacement] feature
  would be a hint like this:
  ~bv[]
  (if (certain-terms-present clause)
      '(:computed-hint-replacement t
        :in-theory (enable lemma25))
      '(:computed-hint-replacement t
        :in-theory (disable lemma25)))
  ~ev[]
  In this hint, if certain terms are present in ~c[clause], as determined
  by the function with the obvious name (here undefined), then this
  hint enables ~c[lemma25] and otherwise disables it.  ~c[Lemma25] might be
  a very expensive lemma, e.g., one that matches frequently and has an
  expensive and rarely established hypothesis.  One might wish it enabled
  only under certain conditions.  Recall that theories are inherited by
  children.  So once ~c[lemma25] is enabled it ``stays'' enabled for the
  children, until disabled; and vice versa.  If the
  ~c[:computed-hint-replacement] feature were not present and computed
  hints were always deleted after they had been used, then ~c[lemma25]
  would be left enabled (or disabled) for all the childen produced by the
  first firing of the hint.  But with the arrangement here, every subgoal
  gets a theory deemed suitable by the hint, and the hint persists.

  Now we will set up a toy to allow us to play with computed hints to
  understand them more deeply.  To follow the discussion it is best
  to execute the following events.
  ~bv[]
  (defstub wrapper (x) t)
  (defaxiom wrapper-axiom (wrapper x) :rule-classes nil)
  ~ev[]
  Now submit the following event and watch what happens.
  ~bv[]
  (thm (equal u v)
    :hints (`(:use (:instance wrapper-axiom (x a)))))
  ~ev[]
  The theorem prover adds ~c[(wrapper a)] to the goal
  and then abandons the proof attempt because it cannot prove the
  subgoal.  Since the computed hint is deleted upon use, the
  hint is not applied to the subgoal (i.e., the child of the goal).

  What happens if we do the following?
  ~bv[]
  (thm (equal u v)
    :hints (`(:computed-hint-replacement t
              :use (:instance wrapper-axiom (x a)))))
  ~ev[]

  As one might expect, this loops forever: The hint is applied to the
  child and adds the hypothesis again.  When the hint fires, nothing
  is actually changed, since ~c[(wrapper a)] is already in the
  subgoal.

  So let's change the experiment a little.  Let's make the hint
  add the hypothesis ~c[(wrapper p)] where ~c[p] is the first literal
  of the clause.  This is silly but it allows us to explore the
  behavior of computed hints a little more.
  ~bv[]
  (thm (equal u v)
    :hints (`(:use (:instance wrapper-axiom (x ,(car clause))))))
  ~ev[]
  So in this case, the theorem prover changes the goal to
  ~bv[]
  (IMPLIES (WRAPPER (EQUAL U V)) (EQUAL U V))
  ~ev[]
  which then simplifies to
  ~bv[]
  (IMPLIES (WRAPPER NIL) (EQUAL U V))
  ~ev[]
  because the concluding equality can be assumed false in the hypothesis
  (e.g., think of the contrapositive version).  Nothing else happens because
  the hint has been removed and so is not applicable to the child.

  Now consider the following -- and be ready to interrupt it and abort!
  ~bv[]
  (thm (equal u v)
    :hints (`(:computed-hint-replacement t
              :use (:instance wrapper-axiom (x ,(car clause))))))
  ~ev[]
  This time the hint is not removed and so is applied to the child.
  So from ~c[Goal] we get
  ~bv[]
  Goal'
  (IMPLIES (WRAPPER (EQUAL U V))
           (EQUAL U V))
  ~ev[]
  and then
  ~bv[]
  Goal''
  (IMPLIES (AND (WRAPPER (NOT (WRAPPER (EQUAL U V))))
                (WRAPPER (EQUAL U V)))
           (EQUAL U V))
  ~ev[]
  etc.

  First, note that the hint is repeatedly applied to its children.
  That is because we wrote ~c[:computed-hint-replacement t].
  But second, note that ~c[Goal'] is not even being simplified
  before ~c[Goal''] is produced from it.  If it were being simplified,
  the ~c[(equal u v)]'s in the hypotheses would be replaced by ~c[nil].
  This is a feature.  It means after a computed hint has fired, other
  hints are given a chance at the result, even the hint itself unless
  it is removed from the list of hints.

  As an exercise, let's arrange for the hint to stay around and be
  applied indefinitely but with a simplification between each use of the
  the hint.  To do this we need to pass information from one application
  of the hint to the next, essentially to say ``stay around but don't fire.''

  First, we will define a function to use in the hint.  This is more
  than a mere convenience; it allows the hint to ``reproduce itself''
  in the replacement.

  ~bv[]
  (defun wrapper-challenge (clause parity)
    (if parity
        `(:computed-hint-replacement ((wrapper-challenge clause nil))
          :use (:instance wrapper-axiom (x ,(car clause))))
        `(:computed-hint-replacement ((wrapper-challenge clause t)))))
  ~ev[]

  Note that this function is not recursive, even though it uses its
  own name.  That is because the occurrence of its name is in a quoted
  constant.

  Now consider the following.  What will it do?

  ~bv[]
  (thm (equal u v)
    :hints ((wrapper-challenge clause t)))
  ~ev[]

  First, observe that this is a legal hint because it is a term that
  mentions only the free variable ~c[CLAUSE].  When defining hint functions
  you may sometimes think their only arguments are the four variables
  ~c[id], ~c[clause], ~c[world], and ~c[stable-under-simplificationp].
  That is not so.  But in your hints you must call those functions so that
  those are the only free variables.  Note also that the occurrence of
  ~c[clause] inside the ~c[:computed-hint-replacement] is not an occurrence
  of the variable clause but just a constant.  Just store this note
  away for a moment.  We'll return to it momentarily.

  Second, the basic cleverness of this hint is that every time it fires
  it reproduces itself with the opposite parity.  When the parity is
  ~c[t] it actually changes the goal by adding a hypothesis.  When
  the parity is ~c[nil] it doesn't change the goal and so allows
  simplification to proceed -- but it swaps the parity back to ~c[t].
  What you can see with this simple toy is that we can use the computed
  hints to pass information from parent to child.

  Ok, so what happens when the event above is executed?  Try it.  You will
  see that ACL2 applied the hint the first time.  It doesn't get around to
  printing the output because an error is caused before it can print.
  But here is a blow-by-blow description of what happens.  The hint is
  evaluated on ~c[Goal] with the ~c[clause] ~c[((equal u v))].  It produces
  a hint exactly as though we had typed:
  ~bv[]
  (\"Goal\" :use (:instance wrapper-axiom (x (equal u v))))
  ~ev[]
  which is applied to this goal. In addition, it produces the new hints
  argument
  ~bv[]
  :hints ((wrapper-challenge clause nil)).
  ~ev[]
  By applying the ~c[\"Goal\"] hint we get the new subgoal
  ~bv[]
  Goal'
  (implies (wrapper (equal u v))
           (equal u v))
  ~ev[]
  but this is not printed because, before printing it, the theorem prover
  looks for hints to apply to it and finds
  ~bv[]
  (wrapper-challenge clause nil)
  ~ev[]
  That is evaluated and produces a hint exactly as though we had typed:
  ~bv[]
  (\"Goal'\" )
  ~ev[]
  and the new hints argument:
  ~bv[]
  :hints ((wrapper-challenge clause nil)).
  ~ev[]
  But if you supply the hint ~c[(\"Goal'\" )], ACL2 will signal an error
  because it does not allow you to specify an empty hint!

  So the definition of ~c[wrapper-challenge] above is almost correct
  but fatally flawed.  We need a non-empty ``no-op'' hint.  One such
  hint is to tell the system to expand a term that will always be expanded
  anyway.  So undo ~c[wrapper-challenge], redefine it, and try
  the proof again.  Now remember the observation about ~c[clause] that
  we asked you to ``store'' above.  The new definition of ~c[wrapper-challenge]
  illustrates what we meant.  Note that the first formal parameter of
  ~c[wrapper-challenge], below, is no longer named ~c[clause] but is called
  ~c[cl] instead.  But the ``call'' of ~c[wrapper-challenge] in the
  replacements is on ~c[clause].  This may seem to violate the rule that
  a function definition cannot use variables other than the formals.
  But the occurrences of ~c[clause] below are not variables but constants
  in an object that will eventually be treated as hint term.
  ~bv[]
  :ubt wrapper-challenge

  (defun wrapper-challenge (cl parity)
    (if parity
        `(:computed-hint-replacement ((wrapper-challenge clause nil))
          :use (:instance wrapper-axiom (x ,(car cl))))
        `(:computed-hint-replacement ((wrapper-challenge clause t))
          :expand ((atom zzz)))))

  (thm (equal u v)
    :hints ((wrapper-challenge clause t)))
  ~ev[]

  This time, things go as you might have expected!  ~c[Goal'] is produced
  and simplified, to
  ~bv[]
  Goal''
  (implies (wrapper nil)
           (equal u v)).
  ~ev[]
  Simplification gets a chance because when the new hint
  ~c[(wrapper-challenge clause nil)] is fired it does not change the
  goal.  But it does change the parity in the hints argument so that
  before ~c[Goal''] is simplified again, the hint fires and adds the
  hypothesis:
  ~bv[]
  Goal'''
  (IMPLIES (AND (WRAPPER (NOT (WRAPPER NIL)))
                (WRAPPER NIL))
           (EQUAL U V)).
  ~ev[]
  This simplifies, replacing the first ~c[(NOT (WRAPPER NIL))] by ~c[NIL],
  since ~c[(WRAPPER NIL)] is known to be true here.  Thus the goal
  simplifies to
  ~bv[]
  Goal'4'
  (IMPLIES (WRAPPER NIL) (EQUAL U V)).
  ~ev[]
  The process repeats indefinitely.

  So we succeeded in getting a hint to fire indefinitely but allow a
  full simplification between rounds.")

(deflabel using-computed-hints-7

  Using the ~c[stable-under-simplificationp] flag~/~/

  A problem with the example in ~il[using-computed-hints-6] is that
  exactly one simplification occurs between each (effective) firing
  of the hint.  Much more commonly we wish to fire a hint once
  a subgoal has become stable under simplification.

  A classic example of this is when we are dealing with an interpreter
  for some state machine.  We typically do not want the ``step''
  function to open up on the symbolic representation of a state until
  that state has been maximally simplified.  We will illustrate with
  a simple state machine.

  Let us start by defining the step function, ~c[stp], and the
  corresponding ~c[run] function that applies it a given number of times.
  ~bv[]
  (defun stp (s)
    (+ 1 s))

  (defun run (s n)
    (if (zp n)
        s
        (run (stp s) (- n 1))))
  ~ev[]
  The step function here is trivial:  a state is just a number and the
  step function increments it.  In this example we will not be interested
  in the theorems we prove but in how we prove them.  The formula we will
  focus on is
  ~bv[]
  (thm (equal (run s 7) xxx))
  ~ev[]
  This is not a theorem, of course.  But we want to test our advice
  on non-theorems because we do not want the advice to work only
  for proofs that succeed.  (In the past, we gave advice about
  using computed hints and that advice caused the theorem prover to
  run forever when given formulas that it couldn't prove -- but
  most of the time the system is presented with formulas it cannot
  prove!)

  Furthermore, without some kind of additional rules, the ~c[(run s 7)]
  expression in the conjecture above will not expand at all, because ACL2's
  heuristics do not approve.

  In fact, we do not want to take chances that ~c[run] will be
  expanded -- we want to control its expansion completely.
  Therefore, disable ~c[run].

  ~bv[]
  (in-theory (disable run))
  ~ev[]

  Now, what do we want?  (That is always a good question to ask!)  We want
  ~c[(run s 7)] to expand ``slowly.''  In particular, we want it to expand
  once, to ~c[(run (stp s) 6)].  Then we want the ~c[stp] to be expanded and
  fully simplified before the ~c[run] expression is expanded again.  That is,
  we want to force the expansion of ~c[run] whenever the goal is stable under
  simplification.  This is sometimes called ``staged simplification.''

  We can achieve staged simplification for any given function symbol by
  defining the functions shown below and then using a simple computed hint:

  ~bv[]
  (thm (equal (run s 7) xxx)
       :hints ((stage run)))
  ~ev[]

  By inspecting how ~c[stage] is defined you can see how to extend it,
  but we explain as we go.  To experiment, you can just paste the
  definitions (and defmacro) below into your ACL2 shell and then
  try the ~c[thm] command.

  First, define this pair of mutually recursive functions.
  ~c[Find-first-call] finds the first call of the function symbol ~c[fn]
  in a given term.

  ~bv[]
  (mutual-recursion
   (defun find-first-call (fn term)
   ; Find the first call of fn in term.
    (cond ((variablep term) nil)
          ((fquotep term) nil)
          ((equal (ffn-symb term) fn)
           term)
          (t (find-first-call-lst fn (fargs term)))))
   (defun find-first-call-lst (fn lst)
   ; Find the first call of fn in a list of terms.
    (cond ((endp lst) nil)
          (t (or (find-first-call fn (car lst))
                 (find-first-call-lst fn (cdr lst)))))))
  ~ev[]

  We will arrange for the computed hint to generate an ~c[:EXPAND]
  hint for the first call of ~c[fn], whenever the goal becomes
  stable under simplification.  If no call is found, the
  hint will do nothing.  To make sure the hint will not loop
  indefinitely (for example, by forcing ~c[fn] to expand only to
  have the rewriter ``fold'' it back up again), we will provide
  the hint with a bound that stops it after some number of
  iterations.  Here is the basic function that creates the
  ~c[expand] hint and replaces itself to count down.

  ~bv[]
  (defun stage1 (fn max clause flg)
  ; If the clause is stable under simplification and there is a call of
  ; fn in it, expand it.  But don't do it more than max times.
   (let ((temp (and flg
                    (find-first-call-lst fn clause))))
     (if temp
         (if (zp max)
             (cw \"~~%~~%HINT PROBLEM:  The maximum repetition count of ~~
                  your STAGE hint been reached without eliminating ~~
                  all of the calls of ~~x0.  You could supply a larger ~~
                  count with the optional second argument to STAGE ~~
                  (which defaults to 100).  But think about what is ~~
                  happening! Is each stage permanently eliminating a ~~
                  call of ~~x0?~~%~~%\"
                 fn)
           `(:computed-hint-replacement
              ((stage1 ',fn ,(- max 1)
                       clause
                       stable-under-simplificationp))
             :expand (,temp)))
       nil)))
  ~ev[]

  Suppose that when ~c[stage1] is called, ~c[fn] is the function we want to
  expand, ~c[max] is the maximum number of iterations of this expansion,
  ~c[clause] is the current goal clause, and ~c[flg] is the value of the
  ~c[stable-under-simplificationp] flag.  Then if ~c[clause] is stable and we
  can find a call of ~c[fn] in it, we ask whether ~c[max] is exhausted.  If
  so, we print an ``error message'' to the comment window with ~ilc[cw] and
  return ~c[nil] (the value of ~c[cw]).  That ~c[nil] means the hint does
  nothing.  But if ~c[max] is not yet exhausted, we return a new hint.  As
  you can see above, the hint replaces itself with another ~c[stage1] hint
  with the same ~c[fn] and a decremented ~c[max] to be applied to the new
  ~c[clause] and the then-current value of ~c[stable-under-simplificationp].
  The hint also contains an ~c[:expand] directive for the call of ~c[fn]
  found.

  Thus, if the computed hint was:

  ~bv[]
  (stage1 'run 5 clause stable-under-simplificationp)
  ~ev[]

  and ~c[(run s 7)] occurs in the clause, then it will
  generate

  ~bv[]
  (:computed-hint-replacement
    ((stage1 'run 4 clause stable-under-simplificationp))
   :expand ((run s 7)))
  ~ev[]
  which will in turn replace the old ~c[stage1] hint with
  the new one and will apply ~c[:expand ((run s 7))] to
  the current goal.

  We can make this more convenient by defining the macro:
  ~bv[]
  (defmacro stage (fn &optional (max '100))
   `(stage1 ',fn ,max clause stable-under-simplificationp))
  ~ev[]
  Note that the macro allows us to either provide the maximum
  bound or let it default to 100.

  Henceforth, we can type
  ~bv[]
  (thm (equal (run s 7) xxx)
       :hints ((stage run)))
  ~ev[]
  to stage the opening of ~c[run] up to 100 times, or we can write
  ~bv[]
  (thm (equal (run s 7) xxx)
       :hints ((stage run 5)))
  ~ev[]
  to stage it only 5 times.  In the latter example, the system
  with print a ``error message'' after the fifth expansion.

  Note that if we executed
  ~bv[]
  (set-default-hints '((stage run)))
  ~ev[]
  then we could attack all theorems (involving ~c[run]) with
  staged simplification (up to bound 100), without typing an
  explicit hint.
  ~bv[]
  (thm (equal (run s 7) xxx))
  ~ev[]

  Using techniques similar to those above we have implemented ``priority phased
  simplification'' and provided it as a book.  See community book
  ~c[books/misc/priorities.lisp].  This is an idea suggested by Pete Manolios,
  by which priorities may be assigned to rules and then the simplifier
  simplifies each subgoal maximally under the rules of a given priority before
  enabling the rules of the next priority level.  The book above documents both
  how we implement it with computed hints and how to use it.

  Here is another example of using the ~c[stable-under-simplificationp] flag to
  delay certain actions.  It defines a default hint, ~pl[DEFAULT-HINTS],
  which will enable ~il[non-linear-arithmetic] on precisely those goals
  which are stable-under-simplificationp.  It also uses the ~c[HISTORY] and
  ~c[PSPV] variables to determine when toggling ~il[non-linear-arithmetic] is
  appropriate.  These variables are documented only in the source code.  If
  you start using these variables extensively, please contact the developers
  of ACL2 or Robert Krug (~c[rkrug@cs.utexas.edu]) and let us know how we can
  help.

  Some Final Comments~/

  None of the examples show the use of the variable ~c[WORLD], which is
  allowed in computed hints.  There are some (undocumented) ACL2
  utilities that might be useful in programming hints, but these
  utilities need access to the ACL2 logical world (~pl[world]).

  A very useful fact to know is that ~c[(table-alist name world)]
  returns an alist representation of the current value of the ~ilc[table]
  named ~c[name].

  The ACL2 source code is littered with ~c[:]~ilc[program] mode
  functions for manipulating world.  In our source code, the
  world is usually bound a variable named ~c[wrld]; so searching
  our code for that name might be helpful.~/

  Using these utilities to look at the ~c[WORLD] one can, for example,
  determine whether a symbol is defined recursively or not, get the
  body and formals of a defined function, or fetch the statement of a
  given lemma.  Because these utilities are not yet documented, we do
  not expect users to employ ~c[WORLD] in computed hints.  But experts
  might and it might lead to the formulation of a more convenient
  language for computed hints.

  None of our examples illustrated the 7 argument form of a computed
  hint,
  ~c[(fn ID CLAUSE WORLD STABLE-UNDER-SIMPLIFICATIONP HIST PSPV CTX)].
  When used, the variables ~c[HIST], ~c[PSPV], and ~c[CTX], are bound
  to the clause history, the package of ``special variables'' governing
  the clause, and the ``error message context.''  These variables are
  commonly used throughout our source code but are, unfortunately,
  undocumented.  Again, we expect a few experts will find them useful
  in developing computed hints.

  If you start using computed hints extensively, please contact the
  developers of ACL2 and let us know what you are doing with them and
  how we can help.")

; Essay on Trust Tags (Ttags)

; Here we place the bulk of the code for handling trust tags (ttags).

; A trust tag (ttag) is a keyword that represents where to place responsibility
; for potentially unsafe operations.  For example, suppose we define a
; function, foo, that calls sys-call.  Any call of sys-call is potentially
; unsafe, in the sense that it can do things not normally expected during book
; certification, such as overwriting a file or a core image.  But foo's call of
; sys-call may be one that can be explained somehow as safe.  At any rate,
; translate11 allows this call of sys-call if there is an active trust tag
; (ttag), in the sense that the key :ttag is bound to a non-nil value in the
; acl2-defaults-table.  See :doc defttag for more on ttags, in particular, the
; ``TTAG NOTE'' mechanism for determining which files need to be inspected in
; order to validate the proper use of ttags.

; There is a subtlety to the handling of trust tags by include-book in the case
; of uncertified books.  Consider the following example.  We have two books,
; sub.lisp and top.lisp, but we will be considering two versions of sub.lisp,
; as indicated.

; sub.lisp
; (in-package "ACL2")
; ; (defttag :sub-ttag1) ; will be uncommented later
; (defun f (x) x)

; top.lisp
; (in-package "ACL2")
; (encapsulate
;  () ;; start lemmas for sub
;
;  (include-book "sub")
;  )

; Now take the following steps:

; In a fresh ACL2 session:
; (certify-book "sub")
; (u)
; (certify-book "top")

; Now edit sub.lisp by uncommenting the defttag form.  Then, in a fresh ACL2
; session:
; (certify-book "sub" 0 t :ttags :all)
; (u)
; (include-book "top")

; The (include-book "top") form will fail when the attempt is made to include
; the book "sub".  To see why, first consider what happens when a superior book
; "top" includes a subsidiary certified book "sub".  When include-book-fn1 is
; called in support of including "sub", the second call of
; chk-acceptable-ttags1 therein uses the certificate's ttags, stored in
; variable cert-ttags, to refine the state global 'ttags-allowed.  After that
; check and refinement, which prints ttag notes based on cert-ttags,
; ttags-allowed is bound to cert-ttags for the inclusion of "sub", with further
; ttag notes omitted during that inclusion.

; Returning to our example, the recertification of "sub" results in the
; addition of a ttag for "sub" that has not yet been noticed for "top".  So
; when we include "top", state global ttags-allowed is bound to nil, since that
; is the cert-ttags for "top".  When sub is encountered, its additional ttag is
; not allowed (because ttags-allowed is nil), and we get an error.

; In a way, this error is unfortunate; after all, top is uncertified, and we
; wish to allow inclusion of uncertified books (with a suitable warning).  But
; it seems non-trivial to re-work the scheme described above.  In particular,
; it seems that we would have to avoid binding ttags-allowed to nil when
; including "top", before we realize that "top" is uncertified.  (The check on
; sub-book checksums occurs after events are processed.)  We could eliminate
; this "barrier" under which we report no further ttag notes, but that could
; generate a lot of ttag notes -- even if we defer, we may be tempted to print
; a note for each defttag encountered in a different sub-book.

; That said, if the need is great enough for us to avoid the error described
; above, we'll figure out something.

; Finally, we note that trust tags are always in the "KEYWORD" package.  This
; simplifies the implementation of provisional certification.  Previously
; (after Version_4.3 but before the next release), Sol Swords sent an example
; in which the Complete operation caused an error, the reason being that an
; unknown package was being used in the post-alist in the certificate file.

(defmacro ttags-seen ()

; The following is a potentially useful utility, which we choose to include in
; the ACL2 sources rather than in community book books/hacking/hacker.lisp.

  ~ev[]
  This output indicates that the current logical ~il[world] has seen the
  declaration of trust tag ~c[T] at the top-level (~pl[defttag]) and the
  declaration of trust tag ~c[FOO] in the two books included from the listed
  locations.  The warning emphasizes that this command cannot be used to
  validate the ``purity'' of an ACL2 session, because using a ttag renders
  enough power to hide from this or any other command the fact that the ttag
  was ever declared.~/

  As discussed elsewhere (~pl[defttag]), the only reliable way to validate
  the ``purity'' of a session is to watch for ``~c[TTAG NOTE]'' output.

  Another shortcoming of this command is that it only checks the current
  logical ~il[world] for ttag declarations.  For example, one could execute a
  ~ilc[defttag] event; then use ~ilc[progn!] and ~ilc[set-raw-mode] to replace
  system functions with corrupt definitions or to introduce inconsistent axioms
  in the ~ilc[ground-zero] ~il[world]; and finally, execute
  ~c[:]~ilc[ubt!]~c[ 1] to remove all evidence of the ttag in the ~il[world]
  while leaving in place the corrupt definitions or axioms.  The base world is
  now tainted, meaning we could prove ~c[nil] or certify a book that proves
  ~c[nil], but the resulting session or book would contain no trace of the ttag
  that tainted it!

  Despite shortcomings, this command might be useful to system hackers.  It
  also serves to illustrate the inherent flaw in asking a session whether or
  how it is ``tainted'', justifying the ``~c[TTAG NOTE]'' approach
  (~pl[defttag])."

  ACL2 will enter a deferred mode for the printing of ttag notes.  In this
  mode, only the first ttag note is printed for each top-level command, and the
  remainder are summarized before the next top-level prompt (if any) is
  printed, hence before the next command is evaluated.  That summary is merely
  a list of ttags, but the summary explains that the full ttag notes may be
  printed with the command ~c[(show-ttag-notes)].

  Note that ~c[(show-ttag-notes)] spares you duplicate ttag notes.  If you want
  to see every ttag note as it would normally appear, for maximum security, do
  not evaluate the command ~c[(set-deferred-ttag-notes t state)].  You can undo
  the effect of this command, returning to an immediate mode for printing ttag

; Why did this cause an error?  The problem was that when restoring the world
; from after bar up to the inner progn (due to its protection by
; revert-world-on-error), memoize-fn was calling cltl-def-from-name on (w
; *the-live-state*), but this world did not contain enough information for that

; nil in that case, which is why we roll back to the previous command, not
; event.  We might consider rolling back to the previous event in all cases,
; not just when certifying or including a book.  But perhaps that's risky,
; since one can execute non-events like defuns-fn in the loop that one cannot
; execute in a book without a trust tag (or in make-event; hmmmm...).)

; See add-trip for a call of memoize-fn using the arguments indicated below.
; We have seen an error result due to revert-world-on-error winding back to a
; command landmark.  See set-w! for a comment about this, which explains how
; problem was fixed after Version_3.6.1.  However, we prefer to fix the problem
; here as well, by avoiding the call of cltl-def-from-name in memoize-fn that
; could be attempting to get a name during extend-world1 from a world not yet
; installed.  So we make that call here, just below, and store the result in

; This is an unusual "event" because it sometimes has no effect on
; STATE and thus is not an event!  In general this function applies
; an operation, op, to some arguments (and to the table named name).
; Ideally, args is of length four and of the form (key val op term).
; But when args is shorter it is interpreted as follows.

; args              same as args

; (key val)         (key val :put   nil)
; (key val op)      (key val op     nil)

; Key and val are both treated as forms and evaluated to produce
; single results (which we call key and val below).  Op and term are
; not evaluated.  A rational version of this function that takes key,
; val, op and term all as normal arguments is table-fn1.  The odd
; design of this function with its positional interpretation of op and
; odd treatment of evaluation is due to the fact that it represents
; the macroexpansion of a form designed primarily to be typed by the
; user.

; Op may be any of :alist, :get, :put, :clear, or :guard.  Each op
; enforces certain restrictions on the other three arguments.

; op         restrictions and meaning
; :alist     Key val and term must be nil.  Return the table as an
;            alist pairing keys to their non-nil vals.
; :get       Val and term must be nil.Return the val associated with
;            key.
; :put       Key and val satisfy :guard and term must be nil.  Store
;            val with key.
; :clear     Key and term must be nil.  Clear the table, setting it
;            to val if val is supplied (else to nil).  Note that val
;            must be an alist, and as with :put, the keys and entries
;            must satisfy the :guard.
; :guard     Key and val must be nil, term must be a term mentioning
;            only the variables KEY, VAL, and WORLD, and returning one
;            result.  The table must be empty.  Store term as the
;            table's :guard.

; Should table events be permitted to have documentation strings?  No.
; The reason is that we do not protect other names from being used as
; tables.  For example, the user might set up a table with the name
; defthm.  If we permitted a doc-string for that table, :DOC defthm
; would be overwritten.
