Here we begin with a discussion of how to <A HREF="#Invoking">invoke ACL2</A>
interactively.  We then discuss <A HREF="#Testing">testing</A> as well as the
<A HREF="#Certifying">certification</A> of ACL2 <em>community
books</em>.  We conclude with a discussion of
the <A HREF="#Documentation">documentation</A>.

<BR><HR><BR>
<H3><A NAME="Invoking">Invoking ACL2</A></H3>

At this point, <I>dir</I> has a subdirectory called <code>acl2-sources</code>.
The sources and perhaps an executable image are located on that subdirectory.
However, if you have not saved an image but instead use the directions
for <A HREF="obtaining-and-installing.html#Running">Running Without Building an Executable Image</A>, skip
to <A HREF="#Starting">When ACL2 Starts Up</A> below.

<P>

The executable image is called <code>acl2-sources/saved_acl2</code>.  You can
invoke ACL2 by running that image, e.g.,

<BR><BR>
<CODE>mycomputer% </CODE><I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-sources/saved_acl2</CODE>
<BR><BR>

If you on a Unix-like system, then to make it easy to invoke ACL2 by
typing a short command, e.g.,

<BR><BR>
<CODE>mycomputer% acl2</CODE>
<BR><BR>

you may want to install an executable file on your path, e.g.,
<code>/usr/local/bin/acl2</code>, containing the following two lines:

<BR><BR>
<CODE>#!/bin/csh -f</CODE><BR>
<I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-sources/saved_acl2</CODE><BR>
<BR><BR>

Note: A carriage return in the file after the last line above is important!
<P>

<BR>
<H4><A NAME="Starting">When ACL2 Starts Up</A></H4>

When you invoke ACL2, you should see the host Common Lisp 
print a header concerning the ACL2 version, license and copyright.
<P>
Some hosts then automatically enter the ACL2 ``command loop,'' an ACL2
read-eval-print loop with the prompt:
<PRE>
ACL2 !>
</PRE>
Other hosts will leave you in Common Lisp's read-eval-print loop.
If yours is one of the latter, evaluate the Common Lisp expression
<CODE>(ACL2::LP)</CODE> or simply <CODE>(LP)</CODE> if the current
package is <CODE>"ACL2"</CODE>.
<P>
Once in the ACL2 command loop, you can type an ACL2 term, typically
followed by ``return'' or ``enter,'' and ACL2 will evaluate the term,
print its value, and prompt you for another one.  Below are three
simple interactions:
<PRE>
ACL2 !>t
T
ACL2 !>'abc
ABC
ACL2 !>(+ 2 2)
4
</PRE>
<P>

To get out of the ACL2 command loop, type the <code>:q</code> command.
This returns you to the host Common Lisp.  We sometimes call this
``raw Lisp.''  You may re-enter the command loop with
<code>(LP)</code> as above.

<P>
Note that when you are in raw Lisp you can overwrite or destroy ACL2
by executing inappropriate Common Lisp expressions.  <B>All bets are
off once you've exited our loop.</B> That said, many users do it.
For example, you might exit our loop, activate some debugging or trace
features in raw Lisp, and then reenter our loop.  While developing
proofs or tracking down problems, this is reasonable behavior.

<P>
Now you are ready to <A HREF="#Testing">test</A> your image.

<BR><HR><BR>
<H3><A NAME="Testing">Testing ACL2</A></H3>

<P>
An easy way to test the theorem prover is to
type the following term to the ACL2 command loop:
<PRE>
:mini-proveall
</PRE>
This will cause a moderately long sequence of commands to be processed, each of
which is first printed out as though you had typed it.  Each will print some
text, generally a proof of some conjecture.  None should fail.

<P>
A more elaborate test is to <A NAME="#Certifying">certify
    the <em><a href="obtaining-and-installing.html#Obtaining-books">community
    books</a></em>, which is a good idea anyhow; this is our next
    topic.  On a Unix-like system, you can also certify just a
    small but useful subset of the books in a few minutes by
    executing, in directory
<i>dir</i>/<code>acl2-sources</code>:
<pre>
make certify-books-short
</pre>

<BR><HR><BR>
<H3><A NAME="Certifying">Certifying ACL2 Books</A></H3>

The <em>community books</em> have been contributed mainly by users and may
be obtained
as <a href="obtaining-and-installing.html#Obtaining-books">explained
elsewhere</a>, to create subdirectory <CODE>acl2-sources/books</CODE>.
The general topic of books is discussed thoroughly in the ACL2
documentation;
see <CODE>http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/current/BOOKS.html</CODE>.

<P>
Books should be ``certified'' before they are used.  We do not distribute
certificates with our books, mainly because certification produces compiled
code specific to the host.  You should certify the books locally, both as a test of
your ACL2 image and because books generally need to be certified before they
can be used.

<P>
It is easy to re-certify all the community books on a Unix-like system.
We recommend you do this.  If you have entered ACL2, exit to the
operating system, e.g., evaluting the form, <code>(quit)</code>, or by
control-d in many systems.

<P>
While connected to <I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-sources</CODE>, execute
<PRE>
make certify-books
</PRE>

This will generate minimal output to the screen and will probably take an hour
or two.  Failure is indicated by the presence of <code>CERTIFICATION FAILED</code> in the log.

<P>

To remove the files thus created, invoke:
<PRE>
make clean-books
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>certify-books</CODE> target does not cause <code>workshops/</code> books to
be certified.  If you want to certify those books as well, you will
first need to
<a href="http://acl2-books.googlecode.com/files/workshops-6.1.tar.gz">download
the gzipped tar file of the workshops books</a>
from the Google Code website to
the <CODE>books/</CODE> directory, and then gunzip and extract it
to create subdirectory <CODE>workshops</CODE>.
You can certify all the community books, including books for the workshops
(including those from the 1999 workshop as described in the
(hardbound)
book <A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/acl2-books/acs/index.html"><EM>Computer-Aided
    Reasoning: ACL2 Case Studies</EM></A>), using the command:

<PRE>
make regression
</PRE>

Our main installation page contains
a <A HREF="installation.html#certify-books">discussion of options</A>
for the above command, such as avoidance of `<code>make</code>'
option <code>-j</code>.

<P>
By default, certification uses the image
<I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-sources/saved_acl2</CODE>.  You may specify any ACL2
image, as long as it is either a command on your path or an absolute file
name, for example as follows.

<PRE>
make certify-books ACL2=my-acl2

make regression ACL2=/u/smith/projects/acl2/saved_acl2
</PRE>

<P>
We apologize to users of other than Unix-like systems (i.e., other
than Unix, GNU-Linux, and Mac OS X): we do not provide instructions
for recertifying all the community books on such systems, though
there are such environments that can be installed on Windows (e.g.,
Cygwin).  The certification methods provided by the authors of the
books vary greatly and we codified them in the makefile, which is
named <code>GNUmakefile</code>, used above.  Some subdirectories
of the community book (typically installed in <CODE>acl2-sources/books/</CODE>) contain either a
<CODE>README</CODE> file or a <CODE>certify.lsp</CODE> file.  Users
who wish to certify one of these books and who cannot figure out (from
these scant clues) what to type to ACL2 should not hesitate to contact
the authors.

<P>
Next proceed to the section on <A HREF="#Documentation">Documentation</A>.

<BR><HR><BR>
<H3><A NAME="Documentation">Documentation</A></H3>

<P>
ACL2's documentation is a hypertext document that, if printed in book
form, is just over 2050 pages, or about 2.4 megabytes of gzipped
postscript.  Its hypertext character makes it far more pleasing to
read with an interactive browser.  The documentation is available in
several formats: HTML, Texinfo, Postscript and ACL2 documentation
strings, and more recently,
in <a href="http://fv.centtech.com/acl2/6.1/doc/">web-browsable form
with some community books' documentation</a>, courtesy of Jared Davis.  The ACL2
documentation is copyrighted by the Regents of the University of Texas
under the terms of the LICENSE file distributed with ACL2.

<P>
Two Web-based guided tours of ACL2 are available from the home page
noted below.  If you are already familiar with Nqthm, you might find
it useful to look at the documentation node
<CODE>NQTHM-TO-ACL2</CODE>.  Another useful documentation topic for
beginning ACL2 users is the node <CODE>TUTORIAL</CODE>.

<P>
<B>HTML</B>
<P>
The ACL2 Home Page is
<P>
<CODE><A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/index.html">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/index.html</A></CODE>
<P>

The home page provides a selected bibliography, a search button (near the top
of the page), guided tours of the system, and the complete hypertext
documentation tree.

<P>
Once you have installed ACL2, the HTML form of the documentation is
available locally as
<I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-sources/doc/HTML/acl2-doc.html</CODE>.
<BR><BR>
We urge you to browse your local copy of the documentation rather than
our Web copy, simply to reduce Web traffic and the demand on our
server.  (Macintosh users using MacOS 9 and earlier may, however, find
filenames being truncated and hence will want to avoid the local
documentation.)

<P><B>Emacs Info</B><P>

This is a very convenient format for accessing the ACL2 documentation from
within Emacs.  In Emacs, invoke
<PRE>
meta-x info
</PRE>
and then, if you are unfamiliar with Info, type
<PRE>
control-h m
</PRE>
to see a list of commands available.  In particular, type
<BR><BR>
<CODE>g (</CODE><I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-sources/doc/EMACS/acl2-doc-emacs.info)TOP</CODE><BR><BR>
to enter the ACL2 documentation.  Alternatively, your system administrator can
add an ACL2 node to the top-level Info menu.  The appropriate entry might read:
<BR><BR>
<CODE>* ACL2 i.j: (</CODE><I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-sources/doc/EMACS/acl2-doc-emacs).</CODE><BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <CODE>Documentation for ACL2 version i.j.</CODE>
<BR><BR>

Note: The Emacs Info and Postscript versions of our documentation were
created using the file <CODE>acl2-sources/doc/texinfo.tex</CODE> which
is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.  (See that file
for copyright and license information.)

<P>

Users new to emacs may find it helpful to load into emacs the file
</CODE><I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-sources/emacs/emacs-acl2.el</CODE>.  Utilities
offered by this file are documented near the top of the file.

<P><B>Postscript</B><P>

The Postscript version of the documentation is not included in our normal
distribution because it is so much less useful than the hyper-text versions.
But a <A
HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/acl2-book.ps.gz">gzipped
Postscript (2.5 MB)</A> version is available.  It prints as a book of over 2100
pages and contains a Table of Contents and an index to all documented topics.

<P><B>ACL2 Documentation Strings</B><P>

The ACL2 system has facilities for browsing the documentation.  When you are in
the ACL2 command loop, you may query the documentation on a given topic by
typing the command
<BR><BR>
<CODE>:doc </CODE><I>topic</I>
<BR><BR>
where <I>topic</I> is the Lisp symbol naming the topic you want to
learn about.  To learn more about the on-line documentation, type
<CODE>:help</CODE> and then return.

<P>
Note, however, that you may find it more convenient to view the documentation
in a web browser (starting at <CODE>doc/HTML/acl2-doc.html</CODE>) or in Emacs
info (starting at <CODE>doc/EMACS/acl2-doc-emacs.info</CODE>).
