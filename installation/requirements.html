<H3><A NAME="Obtaining-Lisp">Obtaining Common Lisp</A></H3>

ACL2 works on Unix, GNU-Linux, and Mac OS X, which we call "Unix-like
systems", as well as many Windows operating systems (at least
including Windows 98, Windows 2000, and Windows XP).  It can be built
on top of any of the following Common Lisps, listed here
alphabetically.

Often we put timing comparisons
between different lisps in the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/current/new.html">ACL2 News</a>.

<P><B><A NAME="Obtaining-Allegro">Obtaining Allegro Common Lisp</A></B><P>

The website for Allegro Common Lisp, a commercial implementation, is
<code><a href="http://www.franz.com/">http://www.franz.com/</a></code>.
You may be able to obtain a trial version there.

<P><B><A NAME="Obtaining-CCL">Obtaining CCL (OpenMCL)</A></B><P>

Clozure CL (CCL) was formerly known as OpenMCL.  Quoting from the <a
href="http://clozure.com/clozurecl.html">Clozure CL web page</a>:
``Clozure CL is a fast, mature, open source Common Lisp implementation
that runs on Linux, Mac OS X and BSD on either Intel x86-64 or PPC.''

<p>

For Windows users: We observed stalls using CCL 1.5 on Windows (in
May, 2010), though not with CCL 1.4.  We have been told by a CCL
implementor that this bug has been fixed, and people running CCL 1.5
under Windows at a revision less than 13900 should update.

<p>

Here is an easy way to obtain and build the latest version (generally
recommended) for Linux on running on x86 or x86-64.  First execute the
following shell command to create a <code>ccl</code> directory, but
substituting for <code>linuxx86</code>, if appropriate, any of
<code>darwinx86</code> (which we use for modern Macs), <code>freebsdx86</code>,
<code>solarisx86</code>, <code>windows</code>, <code>darwinppc</code>,
or <code>linuxppc</code>.

<pre>
svn co http://svn.clozure.com/publicsvn/openmcl/trunk/linuxx86/ccl
</pre>

Note: if you prefer the latest release, you can obtain that instead,
for example as follows.

<pre>
svn co http://svn.clozure.com/publicsvn/openmcl/release/1.3/linuxx86/ccl
</pre>

Then create a suitable script, say as follows, where <code>DIR</code>
is the directory above the new <code>ccl</code> directory.

<hr>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

tmp=`uname -a | fgrep x86_64`
export CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY=DIR/ccl
# Start up 64-bit or 32-bit lisp, respectively:
if [ "$tmp" != "" ] ; then \
    DIR/ccl/scripts/ccl64 $* ; \
else \
    DIR/ccl/scripts/ccl $* ; \
fi
</pre>
<hr>

Be sure to make your script executable.  For example, if your script
filename is <code>my-script</code> then on linux you might want to
execute the following shell command.

<pre>
chmod +x my-script
</pre>

Now rebuild the CCL lisp image by invoking the above script and then
executing the following commands.

<pre>
(ccl:rebuild-ccl :full t)
(quit)
</pre>

Your script (invoked with a suitable pathname, or just the filename if
the directory is on your path) will now start the updated CCL lisp
image.

Step 3 in
<code><a
href="http://trac.clozure.com/openmcl/wiki/UpdatingFromSource">http://trac.clozure.com/openmcl/wiki/UpdatingFromSource</a></code>
has more details on building from source.
Alternatively, you can download a gzipped tar
file; see <a href="http://trac.clozure.com/openmcl">the main CCL
page</a>, or visit the page of <a
href="http://trac.clozure.com/openmcl/wiki/StableReleasesForACL2">stable
Clozure CL snapshots for ACL2 users</a>.  (Subversion and gzipped tar
files are great, but not so much a CCL disk image (<code>.dmg</code>
file), as we have had a report of the extracted CCL opening its own
window when you start it up.)  If you don't want to write your own
script (as suggested above) then after obtaining CCL, you may wish to
edit file <code>ccl/scripts/ccl</code> or file
<code>ccl/scripts/ccl64</code>, depending on whether you want to
use a 32-bit or 64-bit version (respectively).

<P><B><A NAME="Obtaining-CLISP">Obtaining CLISP</A></B><P>

CLISP is a non-commercial Common Lisp implementation, available from <code><a
href="http://clisp.cons.org/">http://clisp.cons.org/</a></code>.

<P><B><A NAME="Obtaining-CMUCL">Obtaining CMU Common Lisp</A></B><P>

CMU Common Lisp (sometimes called CMUCL) is a non-commercial Common Lisp
implementation, available from <code><a
href="http://www.cons.org/cmucl/">http://www.cons.org/cmucl/</a></code>.

<P><B><A NAME="Obtaining-GCL">Obtaining GCL</A></B><P>

You do not need to fetch GCL if instead
you <A HREF="http://packages.qa.debian.org/a/acl2.html">download a
binary Debian package for ACL2</A>.  Thanks to Camm Maguire for
maintaining this package.  Note that it may take some time after each
ACL2 release for this binary Debian package to be updated for that
release.  Here is a shell command that might be used to obtain that
package.

<pre>
apt-get -q install gcl gcl-doc if running Debian
</pre>

Otherwise, you can fetch GCL in one of the ways described below.

<p>

In Spring 2013 there were updates to GCL, reflected in ACL2, that
allow ACL2 to build not only on traditional ("CLtL1") GCL but also on
ANSI GCL.  Perhaps the best way to fetch a recent GCL is with the
following command.  This particular command will retrieve the latest
development/unstable cvs sources.

<pre>
cvs -z9 -q -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sv.gnu.org:/sources/gcl \
     co -d gcl-2.6.8pre -r Version_2_6_8pre gcl
</pre>

As per GCL installation instructions, you may wish to build GCL as
follows on a 64-bit linux machine, instead
using <code>--enable-maxpage=524288</code> on a 32-bit linux machine,
and perhaps <code>--enable-maxpage=262144</code> on a Mac.

<pre>
./configure --enable-maxpage=1048576
make
</pre>

You can build an ANSI image by adding <code>--enable-ansi</code> to
the above <code>./configure</code> command.  Alternatively, you might
find suitable prebuilt binaries for a variety of machines here:
<br>
<code><a href="http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=gcl">http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=gcl</a></code>

<p>

It might also be possible to fetch GCL
from <code><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcl/">http://www.gnu.org/software/gcl/</a></code>,
though as of this writing (June 4, 2013) those versions are quite old.

<P>

<!--

Through Version_6.1 we included the following instructions, saying
that "GCL maintainer Camm Maguire has suggested the following, in
order of preference (most to least):", as an ordered list:

apt-get -q install gcl gcl-doc if running Debian
Download and install the prebuilt binaries otherwise (if available for your platform)
Download the latest (stable) source tarball and build yourself otherwise
Download the latest (stable) cvs branch and build yourself

However, it's not clear how helpful those instructions are, as opposed
simply to spelling some things out as has been done above.

-->

<!--
Through Version_6.1 there were instructions here from Robert Krug for
building on a Mac.  But Matt Kaufmann built ACL2 on a Mac in May,
2013, by following normal GCL instructions, modified as shown below.
-->

<p>

<i>Note</i>: On rare occasions you may see a hard error, sometimes (not
always) labeled as "bad plist", that may be due to interaction between
GCL and GNU Make.  We have worked with the main GCL implementor but
have not found a way to eliminate these rare errors.

LispWorks is a commercial Common Lisp implementation. You can download
a free, restricted, version
from <code><a href="http://www.lispworks.com/">http://www.lispworks.com/</a></code>.
You may ask the vendor for an evaluation license for the full product
if you are considering purchasing a license.

<P><B><A NAME="Obtaining-SBCL">Obtaining SBCL</A></B><P>

SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp) is a non-commercial Common Lisp
implementation, available from <code><a
href="http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/">http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/</a></code>.

<p>

Note for 32-bit linux users: When building ACL2 with SBCL 1.0.18 and
1.0.39 on 32-bit Linux, we ran out of memory with the SBCL message
"Heap exhausted, game over."  We solved the problem by modifying our
sbcl script to use <code>--dynamic-space-size 2000</code>, for example:

<hr>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
export SBCL_HOME=/projects/acl2/lisps/sbcl/sbcl-1.0.39-x86-linux/output
/projects/acl2/lisps/sbcl/sbcl-1.0.39-x86-linux/src/runtime/sbcl --dynamic-space-size 2000 $*
</pre>
<hr>

Your results may vary; one user has reported solving the problem with
<code>--dynamic-space-size 2000000000</code>.
