ACL2 works on Unix, GNU-Linux, and Mac OS X, which we call "Unix-like
systems", as well as many Windows operating systems (at least
including Windows 98, Windows 2000, and Windows XP).  It can be built
on top of any of the following Common Lisps, listed here
alphabetically.

<P><B><A NAME="Obtaining-Allegro">Obtaining Allegro Common Lisp</A></B><P>

The website for Allegro Common Lisp, a commercial implementation, is
<code><a href="http://www.franz.com/">http://www.franz.com/</a></code>.
You may be able to obtain a trial version there.

<P><B><A NAME="Obtaining-CCL">Obtaining CCL (OpenMCL)</A></B><P>

Clozure CL (CCL) was formerly known as OpenMCL.  Quoting from the <a
href="http://clozure.com/clozurecl.html">Clozure CL web page</a>:
``Clozure CL is a fast, mature, open source Common Lisp implementation
that runs on Linux, Mac OS X and BSD on either Intel x86-64 or PPC.''

<p>

For Windows users: We observed stalls using CCL 1.5 on Windows (in
May, 2010), though not with CCL 1.4.  We have been told by a CCL
implementor that this bug has been fixed, and people running CCL 1.5
under Windows at a revision less than 13900 should update.

<p>

Here is an easy way to obtain and build the latest version (generally
recommended) for Linux on running on x86 or x86-64.  First execute the
following shell command to create a <code>ccl</code> directory, but
substituting for <code>linuxx86</code>, if appropriate, any of
<code>darwinx86</code> (which we use for modern Macs), <code>freebsdx86</code>,
<code>solarisx86</code>, <code>windows</code>, <code>darwinppc</code>,
or <code>linuxppc</code>.

<pre>
svn co http://svn.clozure.com/publicsvn/openmcl/trunk/linuxx86/ccl
</pre>

Note: if you prefer the latest release, you can obtain that instead,
for example as follows (but replace "1.9" by the latest version,
for example as described
at <code>http://ccl.clozure.com/download.html</code>, and
replace <code>linuxx86</code> if appropriate as described above).

<pre>
svn co http://svn.clozure.com/publicsvn/openmcl/release/1.9/linuxx86/ccl
</pre>

Next rebuild the executable by issuing the following commands, but
replace "<code>./lx86cl64</code>" by a suitable executable; e.g., for
64-bit Darwin (on Mac OS) use "<code>./dx86cl64</code>".

<hr>
<pre>
./lx86cl64
(rebuild-ccl :full t)
(quit)
./lx86cl64
(rebuild-ccl :full t)
(quit)
</pre>
<hr>

<p>

Now your CCL executable is up to date.  Next, create a suitable
script, say as follows, where <code>DIR</code> is the full pathname
for the directory above the new <code>ccl</code> directory.

<hr>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

tmp=`uname -a | fgrep x86_64`
export CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY=DIR/ccl
# Start up 64-bit or 32-bit lisp, respectively:
if [ "$tmp" != "" ] ; then \
    DIR/ccl/scripts/ccl64 $* ; \
else \
    DIR/ccl/scripts/ccl $* ; \
fi
</pre>
<hr>

Be sure to make your script executable.  For example, if your script
filename is <code>my-script</code> then on linux you might want to
execute the following shell command.

<pre>
chmod +x my-script
</pre>

Your script (invoked with a suitable pathname, or just the filename if
the directory is on your path) will now start the updated CCL lisp
image.

Step 3 in
<code><a
href="http://trac.clozure.com/openmcl/wiki/UpdatingFromSource">http://trac.clozure.com/openmcl/wiki/UpdatingFromSource</a></code>
has more details on building from source.
Alternatively, you can download a gzipped tar
file; see <a href="http://trac.clozure.com/openmcl">the main CCL
page</a>, or visit the page of <a
href="http://trac.clozure.com/openmcl/wiki/StableReleasesForACL2">stable
Clozure CL snapshots for ACL2 users</a>.  (Subversion and gzipped tar
files are great, but not so much a CCL disk image (<code>.dmg</code>
file), as we have had a report of the extracted CCL opening its own
window when you start it up.)  If you don't want to write your own
script (as suggested above) then after obtaining CCL, you may wish to
edit file <code>ccl/scripts/ccl</code> or file
<code>ccl/scripts/ccl64</code>, depending on whether you want to
use a 32-bit or 64-bit version (respectively).

<P><B><A NAME="Obtaining-GCL">Obtaining GCL</A></B><P>

You might be able
to <A HREF="http://packages.qa.debian.org/a/acl2.html">download a
binary Debian package for ACL2</A>.  Thanks to Camm Maguire for
maintaining this package.  Note however that it may take some time
after each ACL2 release for this binary Debian package to be updated
for that release.  Here is a shell command that might be used to
obtain that package (if running Debian).

<pre>
apt-get -q install gcl gcl-doc
</pre>

Otherwise, it should be easy to obtain and build GCL yourself.  There
are two recommended versions of GCL for building ACL2: GCL 2.6.8 and
GCL 2.6.10.  (GCL 2.6.9, which is <i>not</i> recommended, has some
issues that were fixed in GCL 2.6.10.)  GCL 2.6.8 appeared initially
to be faster for ACL2 regressions than GCL 2.6.10, but we recently
measured GCL 2.6.10 (actually GCL 2.6.10pre, as of Oct. 1, 2013) to be
slightly faster, using non-ANSI builds for both.  We have also had
better success with GCL 2.6.10 than GCL 2.6.8 on a Mac, where 2.6.8
ran out of memory for two regression tests but 2.6.10 (again, actually
2.6.10pre) did not.  Note that GCL 2.6.10 may have better ANSI support
than 2.6.8, and ANSI support is needed if you choose to build
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/current/combined-manual/index.html?topic=ACL2____HONS-AND-MEMOIZATION">ACL2(h)</a>).

<p>

You can fetch GCL 2.6.8 as a tarball from
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcl/">main GNU website for
  GCL</a>.
From GCL source you can build an executable by extracting from the
  tarball, standing in the resulting <code>gcl/</code> directory, and
  issuing one of the following commands.

<pre>
# Recommended for 64-bit Linux:
./configure --enable-maxpage=1048576 && make

# Recommended for Mac OS:
./configure && make

# If you want an ANSI build
# (but add "--enable-maxpage=1048576" in the case of 64-bit Linux, as above):
./configure --enable-ansi && make
</pre>

As of early October 2013, GCL 2.6.10 is not yet available as a
tarball.  However, you can get a pre-release (which we expect to work
fine, having used it successfully ourselves) like this (assuming you
have <code>git</code> installed):

<pre>
git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/gcl.git
cd gcl
git checkout Version_2_6_10pre
cd gcl
</pre>

Then run <code>configure</code> and <code>make</code> as indicated
above.

<!-- I don't know that we need this comment any longer, since we write
    a suitable --dynamic-space-size argument to saved_acl2 scripts.
Note for 32-bit linux users: When building ACL2 with SBCL 1.0.18 and
1.0.39 on 32-bit Linux, we ran out of memory with the SBCL message
"Heap exhausted, game over."  We solved the problem by modifying our
sbcl script to use <code>--dynamic-space-size 2000</code>, for example:

<hr>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
export SBCL_HOME=/projects/acl2/lisps/sbcl/sbcl-1.0.39-x86-linux/output
/projects/acl2/lisps/sbcl/sbcl-1.0.39-x86-linux/src/runtime/sbcl --dynamic-space-size 2000 $*
</pre>
<hr>

Your results may vary; one user has reported solving the problem with
<code>--dynamic-space-size 2000000000</code>.
