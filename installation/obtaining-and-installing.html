ACL2 is more than just the executable image.  You should obtain the distributed
books and a local copy of the documentation.  Start here and we will take
you through the whole process of obtaining and installing ACL2.

<p>

First, create a directory in which to store ACL2 Version 5.0.  We will
call this directory <I>dir</I>.  For example, <I>dir</I> might be
<CODE>/home/jones/acl2/v5-0</CODE>.

<H3>NOTE: If you intend to obtain an incremental release (e.g. 2.9.4 as opposed
to 2.9), please see the <a href="../new.html">ACL2 News</a> for instructions.
Otherwise, continue reading here.</H3>

<p>

A collection of <em>books</em> (ACL2 input files typically including
definitions and theorems) has been developed over the years for use
with ACL2, typically called the "distributed books".  It is important
that you obtain these books, which are distributed from the Google
Code <a href="https://code.google.com/p/acl2-books/">acl2-books
project website</a>; directions are included below.

<BR><HR noshade size=8><BR>
<H2><A NAME="Shortcuts">Pre-built Binary Distributions</A></H2>

Visit the "Recent changes to this page" link on the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/">ACL2 home page</A> to see if
there are other shortcuts available.

<p>

WARNING: Some of these packages might be for old version of ACL2.  We
recommend that you use the latest version of ACL2 (Version 5.0).

<UL>

<LI><B><A NAME="Shortcut-windows">Windows</A></B>

<p>

In the past, a Windows Installer for ACL2 has included a Unix
environment, pre-certified standard and workshop books, and a copy of Gnu
Emacs.  This capability has largely been superseded
by <a href="#Build-Particular">the section on Building an Executable
    Image on Some Particular Systems</a>
and <a href="../distrib/windows/">information about ACL2 on Windows</a>.

<LI><B><A NAME="Shortcut-MacPorts">MacPorts for Mac OS X</A></B>

<p>

ACL2 versions have sometimes been made available under MacPorts.  If
  we learn that an up-to-date version is available, we will add
  instructions here.

<LI><B><A NAME="Shortcut-debian">Debian GNU Linux</A></B>

<p>

A Debian Gnu Linux package is available, which is likely to work on
other Linux systems as well.  Thanks to Camm Maguire for maintaining
this package, and for pointing out that as Debian packages are simply
ar and tar archives, they can be unpacked on any linux system, and who
has said: "If someone is running Debian, all they want to do is
'apt-get install acl2', doing likewise for any optional add-on package
they wish as well, e.g. emacs, infix, etc."  Alternatively, Debian GNU
Linux users may wish
to <A HREF="http://packages.qa.debian.org/a/acl2.html">download the
Debian package for Linux</A>.  Or, see following annotated log,
provided by Camm Maguire, to see another way to proceed.

Obtain the sources and place them in directory
<I>dir</I> as follows.

<p>

(First, a note for Windows users only: we suggest that you obtain a
Unix-like environment or, at least, download a utility such as
<code>djtarnt.exe</code> to use with the <code>-x</code> option on
gzipped tarfiles.  WARNING: At least one user experienced CR/LF issues
when using WinZIP, but we have received the suggestion that people
untarring with that utility should probably turn off smart cr/lf
conversion.)

<UL>

<LI>Save <A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v5-0/distrib/acl2.tar.gz">
    acl2.tar.gz</A> on directory <I>dir</I>.  (You can
    run <code>md5sum</code> and compare
    with <A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v5-0/distrib/acl2-tar-gz-md5sum">
    acl2-tar-gz-md5sum</A> if you wish to verify the transmission.)
  </LI>
<BR>

<LI>Execute the following four Unix commands.  (<b>Note</b>:
Gnu tar is preferred, as there have been some problems with long file
names when using tar provided by SunOS.  You may want to use the -i
option, "<code>tar xpvfi acl2.tar</code>", if you have problems with
other than Gnu tar.  You can see if you have Gnu tar by running
"<code>tar -v</code>".)

    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tar xfz books-5.0.tar.gz</code>
  </li>

  <li><b><font color="red">OR</font></b>, obtain a read-only copy

also <code>workshops/</code> and <code>nonstd/</code> subdirectories
of <code>books/</code>, which (respectively) are books contributed in
support of papers presented at ACL2 workshops, and
books for use with ACL2(r).  However, the first method above does not
provide the workshops books or nonstd books.  You can fetch them
easily as gzipped tarfiles, as follows, using the following links

Then put the gzipped tarfile(s) in
the <CODE>acl2-sources/books/</CODE> directory, connect to that

<H2><A NAME="Create-Image">Creating or Obtaining an Executable Image</A></H2>

The next step is to create an executable image.  The common approach is to
build that image from the sources you have already obtained.
<!-- The following is only for non-incremental releases. -->
However, you may
be able to <A HREF="#Pre-Built-Images">take a short cut by downloading an
ACL2 image</A>, in which case you can skip ahead to <A HREF="#Summary">Summary of
Distribution</A>.  Otherwise you should click on one of the links just below.
<!-- End of only for non-incremental releases. -->
Choose the last option if you are using a Common Lisp on which you cannot save
an image (e.g., a trial version of Allegro Common Lisp).

<P>
PLEASE NOTE: The available memory for ACL2 is determined by the underlying
Common Lisp executable.  If you need more memory, refer to your Common Lisp's
instructions for building an executable.

was created using <code>md5sum</code>.  We may add additional
links from time to time.

Now proceed to <A HREF="using.html">Using ACL2</A>.

<!-- End of only for non-incremental releases. -->

<BR><HR><BR>
<H3><A NAME="Other-Unix">Building an Executable Image on a Unix-like System</A></H3>

We assume you have obtained ACL2 and placed it in directory <I>dir</I>, as
described <A HREF="#Sources">above</A>.
<!-- The following is only for non-incremental releases. -->
If you downloaded a <A
HREF="#Pre-Built-Images">pre-built ACL2 image</A>, you may skip this section.
<!-- End of only for non-incremental releases. -->
Connect to <I>dir</I> as above and execute <BR><BR> <CODE>cd
acl2-sources</CODE><BR> <CODE>make LISP=</CODE><I>xxx</I><BR>
<BR>
where <I>xxx</I> is the command to run your local Common Lisp.
<P>
By default, if no <CODE>LISP=</CODE><I>xxx</I> is specified,
<CODE>LISP=ccl</CODE> is used.  On our hosts, <CODE>ccl</CODE> is the name of
Clozure Common Lisp (CCL), which can be obtained as explained <a
href="requirements.html#Obtaining-CCL">in the Requirements document</a>.

<P>

This will create executable <code>saved_acl2</code> in the
<code>acl2-sources</code> directory.

<P>

The time taken to carry out this process depends on the host processor but may
be only a few minutes for a fast processor.  The size of the resulting binary
image is dependent on which Lisp was used, but it may be up to a
couple hundred megabytes or so.

<P>
This <CODE>make</CODE> works for the Common Lisps listed
in <A HREF="requirements.html">Requirements document</A> on systems we
have tested.  See the file <CODE>acl2-sources/GNUmakefile</CODE> for
further details.  If this <CODE>make</CODE> command does not work for
you, please see the instructions below for <A HREF="#Non-Unix">other

<P>

<BR><HR><BR>
<H3><A NAME="Non-Unix">Building an Executable Image on Other than a

Next we describe how to create a binary image containing ACL2 without
using the `<code>make</code>' utility.  If you are using a <B>trial
version</B> of Allegro Common Lisp, then you may not be able to save
an image.  In that case, skip to <A href="#Running">Running Without
Building an Executable Image</A>.

<P>

See also <a href="#Build-Particular">Building an Executable Image on Some Particular
Systems</a>, in case you want to skip directly to the instructions in one of
its subtopics.

<P>

Otherwise, proceed as follows.

<P>

Your Common Lisp should be one of those listed in
<A HREF="requirements.html">Requirements document</A>.  Filenames
below should default to the <I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-sources</CODE>
directory; please connect to that directory before continuing.

<OL>
<P><LI> Remove file <CODE>nsaved_acl2</CODE> if it exists.</LI>

<P><LI> Start up Common Lisp in the <CODE>acl2-sources</CODE> directory
and submit the following sequence of commands.

<PRE>
  ; Compile
  (load "init.lisp")
  (in-package "ACL2")
  (compile-acl2)
</PRE>

  The commands above will compile the ACL2 sources and create compiled object
  files on your <CODE>acl2-sources</CODE> subdirectory.
</LI>

<P><LI> Now exit your Common Lisp and invoke a fresh copy of it (mainly to avoid
  saving an image with the garbage created by the compilation process). Again
  arrange to connect to the <CODE>acl2-sources</CODE> subdirectory. In the
  fresh Lisp <a name="initialization-first-pass">type</a>:

<PRE>
  ; Initialization, first pass
  (load "init.lisp")
  (in-package "ACL2")
  (load-acl2)
  (initialize-acl2)
</PRE>

  This will load the new object files in the Lisp image and bootstrap ACL2 by
  reading and processing the source files. But the attempt at initialization
  will end in an error saying that it is impossible to finish because a certain
  file was compiled during the processing, thus dirtying the image yet again.
  (If however the attempt ends with an error during compilation of file
  <code>TMP1.lisp</code>, see the first troubleshooting tip <a
  href="#troubleshooting-TMP1">below</a>.)
</LI>

<P><LI> So now exit your Common Lisp and invoke a fresh copy of it (again arranging
  to connect to your <CODE>acl2-sources</CODE> subdirectory). Then, in the
  fresh Lisp type:

<PRE>
  ; Initialization, second pass
  (load "init.lisp")
  (in-package "ACL2")
  (save-acl2 (quote (initialize-acl2))
             "saved_acl2")
</PRE>

  You have now saved an image.  Exit Lisp now.  Subsequent steps will put the
  image in the right place.

<P><LI> Remove <CODE>osaved_acl2</CODE> if it exists.

<P><LI> <b>IF</b> <CODE>saved_acl2</CODE> and <CODE>saved_acl2.dxl</CODE> both exist <b>THEN</b>:
<ul>
     <li>move <CODE>saved_acl2.dxl</CODE> to <CODE>osaved_acl2.dxl</CODE></li>
     <li>move <CODE>saved_acl2</CODE> to <CODE>osaved_acl2</CODE>
         and edit <CODE>osaved_acl2</CODE>, changing <CODE>saved_acl2.dxl</CODE>

<ul>
     <li>move <CODE>saved_acl2</CODE> to <CODE>osaved_acl2</CODE></li>
</ul>
</LI>

<P><LI> Move <CODE>nsaved_acl2</CODE> to <CODE>saved_acl2</CODE>.</LI>

<P><LI> For some Common Lisps, a
     file <CODE>nsaved_acl2.</CODE><em>suffix</em> is created for some
     <em>suffix</em>.
     Move it to: <CODE>saved_acl2.</CODE><em>suffix</em></LI>

<P><LI> Make sure <CODE>saved_acl2</CODE> is executable.  For Windows
this involves two mini-steps:

<blockquote>

(a) Remove the <code>"$*"</code> from the <code>saved_acl2</code>
script (because Windows does not understand <code>$*</code>).
Consequently, any arguments you pass to ACL2 via the command line will
be ignored.

<p>

(b) Rename <code>saved_acl2</code> to <code>saved_acl2.bat</code>, for
example by executing the following command.<br><br>
<code>rename saved_acl2 saved_acl2.bat</code>

Or, you may be able to <a href="#Pre-Built-Images">download a pre-built ACL2 image</a>
for Windows instead of reading this section.
<!-- End of only for non-incremental releases. -->

<p>

Otherwise here are steps to follow.

<ol>
<li><b>FIRST</b> get GCL running on your Windows system using <b>ONE</b> of the
following two options.  Note that GCL can be unhappy with spaces in filenames,
so you should probably save the GCL distribution to a directory whose path is
free of spaces.

<ul>
<li><b>OR</b>, obtain GCL for Windows systems from <code><a
href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcl/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcl/</a></code>
or as explained <a href="#Obtaining-GCL">above</a>.  You
may wish to pick a <code>.zip</code> file from the <code>cvs/</code>
subdirectory (containing pre-releases) that has "<code>mingw32</code>" in the
name.

<li><b>OR ELSE</b>, perhaps you can build GCL on your Windows system from the
sources.  The mingw tools and the cygnus bash shell have been used to build
distributed GCL executables.

</ul>

<li><b>SECOND</b>, create an appropriate GCL batch file.  When we tried running
the script <code>gclm/bin/gclm.bat</code> that came with
<code>gcl-cvs-20021014-mingw32</code> from the above ftp site, a separate
window popped up, and with an error.  Many ACL2 users prefer running in an
emacs shell buffer.  (We obtained emacs for Windows from <code><a
href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/21.2/emacs-21.2-fullbin-i386.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/21.2/emacs-21.2-fullbin-i386.tar.gz</a></code>.)
The following modification of <code>gclm.bat</code> seemed to solve the problem
(your pathnames may vary).
<pre>
@
% do not delete this line %
@ECHO off
set cwd=%cd%
path C:\gcl\gclm\mingw\bin;%PATH%
C:\gcl\gclm\lib\gcl-2.6.1\unixport\saved_gcl.exe -dir C:/gcl/gclm/lib/gcl-2.6.1/unixport/ -libdir  C:/gcl/gclm/lib/gcl-2.6.1/ -eval "(setq si::*allow-gzipped-file* t)" %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
</pre>

<li><b>THIRD</b>, follow the <A HREF="#Non-Unix">instructions for
    other than Unix-like systems</A> above, though the resulting file
    may be called
<code>saved_acl2.exe</code> rather than <code>saved_acl2</code>.

<!-- NOTE to developers: v5-0 below indicates a normal release, which is OK. -->
<!-- Do not edit that for incremental releases. -->

<li><b>FINALLY</b>, create a file <code>acl2.bat</code> as explained in
<code><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v5-0/distrib/images/Readme.html#acl2-bat">
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v5-0/distrib/images/Readme.html</a></code>.

</ol>

<p>

We hope that the above simply works.  If you experience
problems, the following hints may help.

<p>

<b>TROUBLESHOOTING:</b>
<ul>

<li><a name="troubleshooting-TMP1">We</a> tried building ACL2 on Windows XP on
top of GCL, our attempt broke at the end of the "<a
href="#initialization-first-pass">Initialization, first pass</a>" step, while
compiling <code>TMP1.lisp</code>.  That was easily remedied by starting up a
fresh GCL session and invoking <code>(compile-file "TMP1.lisp")</code> before
proceeding to the next step.

<li>Yishai Feldman has provided some nice instructions at <code><a

some of which we have tried to incorporate here.  A useful point made there is
that when you want to quit ACL2, use <code>:good-bye</code> (or
<code>(good-bye)</code> which works even in raw Lisp).  Or you can use
<code>(user::bye)</code> in raw Lisp.  The point is:  Avoid <code>control-c
control-d</code>, even thought that often works fine in emacs under
Unix-like systems.

<li>If the above batch file does not work for some reason, an alternate
approach may be to set environment variables.  You may be able to add to the
<code>PATH</code> variable <i>gcl-dir</i><code>\gcc\bin</code>, where
<i>gcl-dir</i> is the directory where GCL is installed.  To get to the place to
set environment variables, you might be able to go to the control panel, under
system, under advanced.  Alternately, you might be able to get there by opening
<code>My Computer</code> and right-clicking to get to <code>Properties</code>,
then selecting the <code>Advanced</code> tab.  At one time, when GCL/Windows
was release as Maxima, Pete Manolios suggested adding the system variable
LD_LIBRARY_PATH with the value "maxima-dir\gcc\i386-mingw32msvc\include"; this
may or may not be necessary for your GCL installation (and the path would of
course likely be different).

<H2><A NAME="Running">Running Without Building an Executable Image</A></H2>

The most convenient way to use ACL2 is first to install an executable image as
described above for <A HREF="#Other-Unix">Unix-like systems</A> and <A
HREF="#Non-Unix">other</A> platforms.  However, in some cases this is not
possible, for example if you are using a trial version of Allegro Common Lisp.
In that case you should follow the steps below each time you want to start up
ACL2.

<P>

We assume you have obtained ACL2 and placed it in directory <I>dir</I>, as
described above for <A HREF="#Sources">Unix-like systems</A> or <A
HREF="#Sources-Non-Unix">other</A> platforms.
<!-- The following is only for non-incremental releases. -->
(If you downloaded a <A
HREF="#Pre-Built-Images">pre-built ACL2 image</A>, then you may skip this section.)
<!-- End of only for non-incremental releases. -->
Connect to subdirectory <CODE>acl2-sources</CODE> of <I>dir</I>,
start up your Common Lisp, and compile by executing the following forms.
<I>This sequence of steps need only be performed once.</I>

<PRE>
  (load "init.lisp")
  (in-package "ACL2")
  (compile-acl2)
</PRE>

Now each time you want to use ACL2, you need only execute the following forms
after starting up Common Lisp in subdirectory <CODE>acl2-sources</CODE> of
<I>dir</I>.

<PRE>
  (load "init.lisp")
  (in-package "ACL2")
  (load-acl2)
  (initialize-acl2)
</PRE>

<I>Note.</I> The resulting process includes the ACL2 documentation, and hence
will probably be considerably larger (perhaps twice the size) than the result
of running an executable image created as described <A
HREF="#Create-Image">above</A>.

<P>

Now proceed to read more about <A HREF="using.html">Using ACL2</A>.

<H2><A NAME="Summary">Summary of Distribution</A></H2>

The distribution includes the following.  A list of all files in
<CODE>acl2-sources</CODE> may be found in the file <CODE>all-files.txt</CODE>
in that directory.
<PRE>
Readme.html; This file
acl2-sources/
  LICENSE  ; GNU General Public License
  GNUmakefile ; For GNU make.
  TAGS     ; Handy for looking at source files with emacs
  *.lisp   ; ACL2 source files
  all-files.txt    ; List of all files in this directory and subdirectories
  books/   ; NOT INCLUDED; see instructions above to fetch books
  doc/     ; ACL2 documentation in various formats
  emacs/   ; Miscellaneous emacs and file utilities, especially emacs-acl2.el
  init.lisp; Useful for building the system
  interface/
    emacs/ ; Support for ACL2 "proof trees".  See interface/emacs/README.doc.
    infix/ ; ACL2 infix printer by Mike Smith.  See interface/infix/README.
  saved/   ; Empty directory for backing up copies during make; not important
acl2.tar.gz; gzip'd tar file containing all of acl2-sources/ (see below)
images/    ; Some gzip'd tar'd executables; see images/Readme.html
split/     ; The result of splitting up acl2.tar.gz; see split/Readme.html
</PRE>

<P>
The entire acl2.tar.gz is about 6.7MB, which extracts to
about 29MB.  The gzipped tarfile books-5.0.tar.gz (obtained as described
<a href="#Obtaining-books">above</a>) is about 10MB, which extracts to
about 59MB.  Additional space is required to build an image, perhaps
50 to 300 megabytes depending on the platform (including the host
Lisp); and more will be required
to <A HREF="using.html#Certifying">certify books</A>.
