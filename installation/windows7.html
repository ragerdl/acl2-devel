    <h1>Helpful Instructions for Setting up <A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/">ACL2</A> and Windows</h1> 
	
        <p> We thank David Rager for providing the following
        instructions, which we include verbatim and expect apply to
        future versions.  Note: We recommend using CCL for Windows
        builds, in part so that interrupts (Control-C) will work.  If
        you are using Windows, please note that there have been stalls
        using CCL 1.5 on Windows, though not with CCL 1.4.  We have
        been told by a CCL implementor that this bug has been fixed,
        and people running CCL 1.5 under Windows at a revision less
        than 13900 should update.

        </p>

	<p> I was able to get ACL2  3.6.1 to install and build the regression suite
	on Windows 7 with the following steps.  I did not have to install
	cygwin.</p>
	
	
	<ol>
	  <li><p>Install MinGW.  At the time of this writing, the following direct link works<br />
	
		<a
		href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Automated%20MinGW%20Installer/MinGW%205.1.6/MinGW-5.1.6.exe/download">MinGW-5.1.6.exe</a></p>

		<p>If that direct link doesn't work, click on "Automated MinGW Installer"
		on the more general <a
		href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/">MinWG project files
		page</a>.</p>

		</li>
	  
	  <li><p>Install MSys.  At the time of this writing, the following direct link
		  works<br />
		  
		  <a
			href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS%20Base%20System/msys-1.0.11/MSYS-1.0.11.exe/download">MSYS-1.0.11.exe</a></p>
		
		<p>If that direct link doesn't work, click on "MSYS Base System" on the
		  more general <a
			href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/">MinWG project files
			page</a>.</p>
		
	  </li>
	  
	  
	  <li>Add "C:\msys\1.0\bin" to my environment variable "path".  The way you
	  do this varies with each Windows XP/Vista/7.  Roughly speaking, you need
	  to go to the control panel, and open up your system settings.  Get to the
	  advanced system settings and click on environment variables.  Edit the
	  "path" environment variable and add ";C:\msys\1.0\bin" to it.  At this
	  point you might need to restart your computer, but I did not have to do
	  so on Windows 7.  I did, however, have to restart my emacs.</li>
	  
	  <li><p>Realize that using "\" to indicate paths in windows confuses some
	  linux programs and that you might need to use "/" sometimes.</p></li>
	  
	  <li>
		<p>After expanding the ACL2 sources, cd to that directory and type
		  something similar to the following (modify it to set LISP to your LISP
		  executable<sup>1</sup>)<br />
		  
		  <code>make LISP=c:/ccl/wx86cl64.exe</code><br />
		  
		  The "make.exe" that will be used is intentionally the MSys version,
		  not the MinGW version.</p>
	  </li>
	  
	  <li>After your ACL2 image builds, make acl2 executable, specifically
		
		<ul>
		  <li>Remove the "$*" from the saved_acl2 script (because Windows does
			not understand $*). Consequently, any arguments you pass to ACL2 via
			the command line will be ignored.</li>
		  
		  <li>Rename saved_acl2 to saved_acl2.bat, for example by executing the
			following command: <code>rename saved_acl2 saved_acl2.bat</code></li>
		</ul>
	  </li>
	  
	  <li><p>You can now make the regression suite by typing<br />
		<code>make regression ACL2=c:/acl2-3.6.1/acl2-sources/saved_acl2.bat</code>
		</p></li>
	</ol>

	<p><sup>1</sup>I have intentionally ommitted instructions on how to setup a
	LISP on windows.  However, I include one link that should suffice: <a

	CCL</a></p>
