The following five files are useful for running regressions with
ACL2(p):

  parallel-full.lisp
  parallel-resource-based.lisp
  parallel-top-level.lisp
  pseudo-parallel.lisp
  serial.lisp

For example:

(time nice make -j 8 regression-fresh ACL2=/projects/acl2/devel/ccl-saved_acl2p ACL2_CUSTOMIZATION=/projects/acl2/devel/acl2-customization-files/parallel-full.lisp) >& logs/make-regression-par-ccl-j-8-feb27.log&

Note: Sometimes parallelism is defeated or modified for individual
books.  To find out where:

  cd books
  grep -l acl2-par `find . -name "*.acl2"`

For example, hints/basic-tests.acl2 has this:

  #+acl2-par
  ; computed hints that modify state
  (set-waterfall-parallelism nil)
