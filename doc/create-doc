# from the main ACL2 directory.  The environment variable ACL2 is used
# in this script; it is typically set in ../GNUmakefile.  To run this
# script directly in the doc/ directory, submit something like this:

#   (export ACL2=~/acl2/devel/saved_acl2 ; ./create-doc)

# It is our convention to keep the .fig and .gif files in graphics/
# (under the main ACL2 source directory.  The present script copies
# the *.gif files from that source to the doc/HTML subdirectory where
# they will reside for convenient HTML access.

if [ ! -d HTML ] ; then
    mkdir HTML

# Now copy the definitive .gif files over to HTML.

    cp -p ../graphics/*.gif HTML

# At one time we copid the license down to the HTML so the home
# page can reference it, but this no longer seems necessary.

# cp ../LICENSE HTML/LICENSE

# Copy down the files we are allowed to change without rebuilding.
